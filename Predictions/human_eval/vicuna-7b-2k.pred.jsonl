The MMA model combines the power of the Transformer model and the efficiency of monotonic attention. The model is designed to achieve better latency/quality tradeoffs compared to the previous state-of-the-art, MILk, on two standard translation benchmarks, IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese (En-Vi) and WMT15 German-English (DeEn). The MMA model consists of two variants, Hard MMA (MMA-H) and Infinite Lookback MMA (MMA-IL), and two novel latency regularization methods. The first encourages the model to be faster by directly minimizing the average latency, while the second encourages the attention heads to maintain similar positions, preventing the latency from being dominated by a single or a few heads. The paper also includes an analysis on how the model is able to control the attention span and on the relationship between the speed of a head and the layer it belongs to. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) A novel monotonic attention mechanism, monotonic multihead attention, which enables the Transformer model to perform online decoding.

Is that possible that the MMA would have worse latency than MILK since all the attention heads need to agree to write while MILK only has one attention head?\n   2. Is there any attention order between different attention head?\n   3. I think the MMA only could control the latency during training time, which would produce different models with different latency. Is there any way that enables MMA to control the latency during inference time? Can we change the latency for on given model by tuning the requirements mentioned in Eq.

The state-of-the-art model, MILk, outperforms fixed policy approaches and provides a closed-form expression for the expected alignment between source and target tokens. The authors propose monotonic multihead attention (MMA), which combines the high translation quality from multilayer multihead attention and low latency from monotonic attention. They also propose two variants, Hard MMA (MMA-H) and Infinite Lookback MMA (MMA-IL), and two novel latency regularization methods. The main contributions of the paper are better latency/quality tradeoffs compared to the MILk model, the previous state-of-the-art, on two standard translation benchmarks, IWSLT15 English-Vietnamese (En-Vi) and WMT15 German-English (DeEn). The authors motivate the design of their model with an ablation study on the number of decoder layers and the number of decoder heads.\n\nMy opinion is that this paper presents an interesting approach to simultaneous machine translation, which combines the power of the Transformer model and the efficiency of monotonic attention. The authors provide a detailed analysis of their model and demonstrate its effectiveness on two standard translation benchmarks. However, I have some questions about the model's performance on other benchmarks and its generalization ability to other languages. Additionally, I would like to know more about the computational complexity of the proposed model and its scalability to larger datasets. Overall, this paper is a valuable contribution to the field of simultaneous machine translation and provides a promising direction for future research.", "evaluation": "LLM"}

The DenseNet, one of the recently proposed neural network architecture, has achieved the state-of-the-art performance in many visual tasks. However, it has great redundancy due to the dense connections of the internal structure, which leads to high computational costs in training such dense networks. To address this issue, we design a reinforcement learning framework to search for efficient DenseNet architectures with layer-wise pruning (LWP) for different tasks, while retaining the original advantages of DenseNet, such as feature reuse, short paths, etc. In this framework, an agent evaluates the importance of each connection between any two block layers, and prunes the redundant connections. In addition, a novel reward-shaping trick is introduced to make DenseNet reach a better trade-off between accuracy and float point operations (FLOPs). Our experiments show that DenseNet with LWP is more compact and efficient than existing alternatives.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.

While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions.

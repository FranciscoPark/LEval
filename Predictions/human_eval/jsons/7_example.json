If your income is low enough , your payment could be as low as $0 per month. An income - driven repayment plan sets your monthly student loan payment at an amount that is intended to be affordable based on your income and family size.

If you're seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness , you should repay your federal student loans under an income - driven repayment plan. Try This Resource Federal Student Loans : Repaying Your Loans Provides information about federal student loan repayment plan options, finding loan history and loan servicers, and making payments. \n\nHow is my monthly payment amount calculated under an income-driven repayment plan? \nGenerally , your payment amount under an income - driven repayment plan is a percentage of your discretionary income. The percentage is different depending on the plan. The chart below shows how payment amounts are determined under each income - driven plan. Depending on your income and family size , you may have no monthly payment at all. * For the IBR Plan , you're considered a new borrower on or after July 1 , 2014, if you had no outstanding balance on a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program loan or Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program loan when you received a Direct Loan on or after July 1 , 2014. Because no new FFEL Program loans have been made since June 30 , 2010, only Direct Loan borrowers can qualify as new borrowers on or after July 1 , 2014. \n\nHow do I estimate my payment amount? \nUse our Loan Simulator. Loan Simulator provides a comparison of estimated monthly payment amounts for all federal student loan repayment plans, including income - driven plans. This comparison is important because the income - driven plans may not provide you with the lowest payment amount based on your individual circumstances. Your payment may be lower under another repayment plan. \n\nHow long will I be in repayment under each plan? \nIncome - driven repayment plans have different repayment periods. Under all four plans , any remaining loan balance is forgiven if your federal student loans aren't fully repaid at the end of the repayment period. For any income - driven repayment plan , periods of economic hardship deferment , periods of repayment under certain other repayment plans , and periods when your required payment is zero will count toward your total repayment period. Whether you will have a balance left to be forgiven at the end of your repayment period depends on a number of factors, such as how quickly your income rises and how large your income is relative to your debt. Because of these factors , you may fully repay your loan before the end of your repayment period. Your loan servicer will track your qualifying monthly payments and years of repayment and will notify you when you are getting close to the point when you would qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance. If you re making payments under an income - driven repayment plan and also working toward loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF Program , you may qualify for forgiveness of any remaining loan balance after you've made 10 years of qualifying payments, instead of 20 or 25 years. Qualifying payments for the PSLF Program include payments made under any of the income - driven repayment plans. \n\nAm I eligible for income-driven repayment? \nDefaulted loans are not eligible for repayment under any of the income - driven repayment plans. Find out how to get out of default. \n\nREPAYE Plan \nAny borrower with eligible federal student loans can make payments under this plan. \n\nPAYE and IBR Plans \nEach of these plans has an eligibility requirement you must meet to qualify for the plan. To qualify , the payment you would be required to make under the PAYE or IBR plan based on your income and family size must be less than what you would pay under the Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period. If the amount you would have to pay under the PAYE or IBR plan based on your income and family size is more than what you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan , you wouldn't benefit from having your monthly payment amount based on your income , so you don't qualify. Generally , you'll meet this requirement if your federal student loan debt is higher than your annual discretionary income or represents a significant portion of your annual income. In addition to meeting the requirement described above , to qualify for the PAYE Plan you must also be a new borrower. This means that you must have had no outstanding balance on a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan when you received a Direct Loan or FFEL Program loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2007, and you must have received a disbursement of a Direct Loan on or after Oct. 1 , 2011. \n\nICR Plan \nAny borrower with eligible federal student loans can make payments under this plan. This plan is the only available income - driven repayment option for parent PLUS loan borrowers. Although PLUS loans made to parents can t be repaid under any of the income - driven repayment plans including the ICR Plan , parent borrowers may consolidate their Direct PLUS Loans or Federal PLUS Loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan and then repay the new consolidation loan under the ICR Plan though not under any other income - driven plan. \n\nWill I always pay the same amount each month under an income-driven repayment plan? \nNo. Under all of the income - driven repayment plans , your required monthly payment amount may increase or decrease if your income or family size changes from year to year. Each year you must recertify your income and family size. This means that you must provide your loan servicer with updated income and family size information so that your servicer can recalculate your payment. You must do this even if there has been no change in your income or family size. Your loan servicer will send you a reminder notice when it s time for you to recertify. To recertify , you must submit another income - driven repayment plan application. On the application , you ll be asked to select the reason you re submitting the application. Respond that you are submitting documentation of your income for the annual recertification of your payment amount. Although you re required to recertify your income and family size only once each year, if your income or family size changes significantly before your annual certification date for example, due to loss of employment , you can submit updated information and ask your servicer to recalculate your payment amount at any time. To do this , submit a new application for an income - driven repayment plan. When asked to select the reason for submitting the application , respond that you are submitting documentation early because you want your servicer to recalculate your payment immediately. You re not required to report changes in your financial circumstances before the annual date when you must provide updated income information. You can choose to wait until your loan servicer tells you that you need to provide updated income information at the normally scheduled time. If you choose to wait , your current required monthly payment amount will remain the same until you provide the updated income information. \n\nPAYE and IBR Plans \nUnder these plans , your monthly payment amount will be based on your income and family size when you first begin making payments, and at any time when your income is low enough that your calculated monthly payment amount would be less than the amount you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan. If your income ever increases to the point that your calculated monthly payment amount would be more than what you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan, you ll remain on the PAYE or IBR plan , but your payment will no longer be based on your income. Instead , your required monthly payment will be the amount you would pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan, based on the loan amount you owed when you first began repayment under the PAYE or IBR plan. Even if your income continues to increase , your monthly payment will never be more than the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount. During any period when your monthly payment is not based on your income , you still have the option of recertifying your income and family size. If you recertify and your income or family size changes so that your calculated monthly payment would once again be less than the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount , your servicer will recalculate your payment and you ll return to making payments that are based on your income. \n\nREPAYE and ICR Plans \nUnder the REPAYE and ICR Plans , your payment is always based on your income and family size, regardless of any changes in your income. This means that if your income increases over time, in some cases your payment may be higher than the amount you would have to pay under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan. \n\nWhat will happen if I don t recertify my income and family size by the annual deadline? \nIt s important for you to recertify your income and family size by the specified annual deadline. If you don t recertify your income by the deadline , the consequences vary depending on the plan. Under the REPAYE Plan , if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline , you ll be removed from the REPAYE Plan and placed on an alternative repayment plan. Under this alternative repayment plan , your required monthly payment is not based on your income. Instead , your payment will be the amount necessary to repay your loan in full by the earlier of a 10 years from the date you begin repaying under the alternative repayment plan, or b the ending date of your 20- or 25-year REPAYE Plan repayment period. You may choose to leave the alternative repayment plan and repay under any other repayment plan for which you are eligible. Under the PAYE Plan, the IBR Plan, or the ICR Plan, if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline , you ll remain on the same income - driven repayment plan , but your monthly payment will no longer be based on your income. Instead , your required monthly payment amount will be the amount you would pay under a Standard Repayment Plan with a 10-year repayment period, based on the loan amount you owed when you initially entered the income - driven repayment plan. You can return to making payments based on income if you provide your servicer with updated income information, and if your updated income still qualifies you to make payments based on income. In addition to the consequences described above , if you don t recertify your income by the annual deadline under the REPAYE, PAYE, and IBR plans , any unpaid interest will be capitalized added to the principal balance of your loans. This will increase the total cost of your loans over time, because you will then pay interest on the increased loan principal balance. Under all of the income - driven repayment plans , if you don t recertify your family size each year , you ll remain on the same repayment plan , but your servicer will assume that you have a family size of one. If your actual family size is larger, but your servicer assumes a family size of one because you didn t recertify your family size , this could result in an increased monthly payment amount or for the PAYE and IBR plans loss of eligibility to make payments based on income. \n\nWhat types of federal student loans can I repay under an income-driven repayment plan? \nThe chart below shows the types of federal student loans that you can repay under each of the income - driven repayment plans. * If a loan type is listed as eligible if consolidated , this means that if you consolidate that loan type into a Direct Consolidation Loan, you can then repay the consolidation loan under the income - driven plan. For example , only Direct Loans can be repaid under the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR plans. However , if you consolidate a FFEL Program Loan or Federal Perkins Loan into a Direct Consolidation Loan , you may then be able to repay the Direct Consolidation Loan under the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR Plan depending on the type of loan that you consolidate. Note that consolidation is not the right choice for all borrowers or all loan types. In particular , you may lose certain loan benefits if you consolidate a Federal Perkins Loan. Find out more about loan consolidation. Only federal student loans can be repaid under the income - driven plans. Private student loans are not eligible. \n\nIs an income-driven repayment plan right for me? \nIncome - driven repayment plans usually lower your federal student loan payments. However , whenever you make lower payments or extend your repayment period , you will likely pay more in interest over time sometimes significantly more. In addition , under current Internal Revenue Service rules , you may be required to pay income tax on any amount that's forgiven if you still have a remaining balance at the end of your repayment period. \n\nHow do I decide which income-driven repayment plan to choose? \nIf you ve decided that an income - driven repayment plan is right for you , you ll want to choose the plan that provides the most benefit to you based on your individual circumstances. Although all four income - driven plans allow you to make a monthly payment based on your income , the plans differ in terms of who qualifies, how much you have to pay each month, the length of the repayment period, and the types of loans that can be repaid under the plan. If you have only Direct Loans , you can choose from all four income - driven repayment plans. If you re not sure which plan to choose , you have the option of requesting the income - driven plan that provides the lowest payment amount. Your servicer will determine which plans you qualify for and will then place you on the plan with the lowest monthly payment. If you have FFEL Program loans , your only income - driven repayment plan option is the IBR Plan. However , if you consolidate your FFEL Program loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan , you ll then have access to the REPAYE, PAYE, and ICR plans. Find out more about loan consolidation. \n\nHow do I apply for an income-driven repayment plan? \nBefore you apply for an income - driven repayment plan , contact your loan servicer if you have any questions. Your loan servicer will help you decide whether one of these plans is right for you. To apply , you must submit an application called the Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request. You can submit the application online or on a paper form, which you can get from your loan servicer. The application allows you to select an income - driven repayment plan by name, or to request that your loan servicer determine what income - driven plan or plans you qualify for, and to place you on the income - driven plan with the lowest monthly payment amount. Note: If you have more than one servicer for the loans that you want to repay under an income - driven plan , you must submit a separate request to each servicer. When you apply , you ll be asked to provide income information that will be used to determine your eligibility for the PAYE or IBR plans and to calculate your monthly payment amount under all income - driven repayment plans. This may be either your adjusted gross income AGI or alternative documentation of income. Your AGI will be used if you filed a federal income tax return in the past two years , and your current income isn t significantly different from the income reported on your most recent federal income tax return. You can provide your AGI in one of the following ways : Apply using the online Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request and use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool in the application to transfer income information from your federal income tax return. Use the paper Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request and provide a paper copy of your most recently filed federal income tax return or IRS tax return transcript. If you haven t filed a federal income tax return in the past two years, or if your current income is significantly different from the income reported on your most recent federal income tax return for example, if you lost your job or have experienced a drop in income , alternative documentation of your income will be used to determine your eligibility and calculate your monthly payment amount. You can provide alternative documentation in one of the following ways : If you currently receive taxable income , you must submit a paper Income - Driven Repayment Plan Request with alternative documentation of your income, such as a pay stub. If you currently don t have any income or if you receive only untaxed income , you can indicate that on the online or paper application. In this case , you re not required to supply further documentation of your income. Depending on whether you applied electronically or submitted a paper request form and whether you ve submitted all required documents , it may take your servicer a few weeks to process your request, because they will need to obtain documentation of your income and family size. If you are currently repaying your loans under a different repayment plan , your loan servicer may apply a forbearance to your student loan account while processing your request for an income - driven repayment plan. \n\nWhat other options do I have if I need help repaying my student loans? \nIf an income - driven repayment plan isn t right for you , contact your loan servicer to discuss other repayment options. You may be able to extend your repayment period through the Extended Repayment Plan or through loan consolidation. You may also be able to temporarily suspend repayment through a deferment or forbearance. \n\nWhere can I learn more about the income-driven repayment plans? \nWant more information about the income - driven repayment plans?

Keep reading to see whether you might qualify. Alert! If your PSLF application is denied because some or all of your payments were not made under a qualifying repayment plan for PSLF , you might still be eligible for forgiveness through Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Learn more. The PSLF Program forgives the remaining balance on your Direct Loans after you have made 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full - time for a qualifying employer. PSLF Resources Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF Help Tool Public Service Loan Forgiveness : Employment Certification Form Public Service Loan Forgiveness : Application for Forgiveness Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program FAQ \n\nQualifying for PSLF \nTo qualify for PSLF , you must be employed by a U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal government or not - for - profit organization ; work full - time for that agency or organization ; have Direct Loans or consolidate other federal student loans into a Direct Loan ; repay your loans under an income - driven repayment plan; and make 120 qualifying payments. To ensure you re on the right track , you should submit a Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Employment Certification Form annually or when you change employers. We ll use the information you provide on the form to let you know if you are making qualifying PSLF payments. This will help you determine if you re on the right track as early as possible. \n\nQualifying Employment \nQualifying employment for the PSLF Program isn t about the specific job that you do for your employer. Instead , it s about who your employer is. Employment with the following types of organizations qualifies for PSLF : Government organizations at any level U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal Not - for - profit organizations that are tax - exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code Serving as a full - time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteer also counts as qualifying employment for the PSLF Program. The following types of employers do not qualify for PSLF : Labor unions Partisan political organizations For - profit organizations, including for - profit government contractors Contractors : You must be directly employed by a qualifying employer for your employment to count toward PSLF. If you re employed by an organization that is doing work under a contract with a qualifying employer , it is your employer s status not the status of the organization that your employer has a contract with that determines whether your employment qualifies for PSLF. For example , if you re employed by a for - profit contractor that is doing work for a qualifying employer , your employment does not count toward PSLF. Other types of not - for - profit organizations : If you work for a not - for - profit organization that is not tax - exempt under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, it can still be considered a qualifying employer if it provides certain types of qualifying public services. However , in our experience , few organizations meet these criteria. \n\nFull-time Employment \nFor PSLF , you re generally considered to work full - time if you meet your employer s definition of full - time or work at least 30 hours per week, whichever is greater. If you are employed in more than one qualifying part - time job at the same time , you will be considered full - time if you work a combined average of at least 30 hours per week with your employers. If you are employed by a not - for - profit organization , time spent on religious instruction, worship services, or any form of proselytizing may not be counted toward meeting the full - time employment requirement. \n\nEligible Loans \nAny loan received under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Direct Loan Program qualifies for PSLF. Loans from these federal student loan programs don't qualify for PSLF: the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL Program and the Federal Perkins Loan Perkins Loan Program. However , they may become eligible if you consolidate them into a Direct Consolidation Loan. Student loans from private lenders do not qualify for PSLF. If you consolidate your loans , only qualifying payments that you make on the new Direct Consolidation Loan can be counted toward the 120 payments required for PSLF. Any payments you made on the loans before you consolidated them don t count. The PSLF Help Tool will tell you whether you need to consolidate some or all of your loans. \n\nQualifying Payments \nA qualifying monthly payment is a payment that you make after Oct. 1 , 2007 ; under a qualifying repayment plan ; for the full amount due as shown on your bill ; no later than 15 days after your due date ; and while you are employed full - time by a qualifying employer. You can make qualifying monthly payments only during periods when you re required to make a payment. Therefore , you can t make a qualifying monthly payment while your loans are in an in-school status, the grace period , a deferment , or a forbearance. If you want to make qualifying payments, but you re in a deferment or forbearance , contact your federal student loan servicer to waive the deferment or forbearance. Your 120 qualifying monthly payments don t need to be consecutive. For example , if you have a period of employment with a nonqualifying employer , you will not lose credit for prior qualifying payments you made. The best way to ensure that you are making on - time, complete payments is to sign up for automatic debit with your loan servicer. \n\nCan I qualify sooner by making higher monthly payments? \nNo. If you make a monthly payment for more than the amount you are required to pay , you should keep in mind that you can receive credit for only one payment per month, no matter how much you pay. You can t qualify for PSLF faster by making larger payments. If you want to pay more than your required monthly payment amount , you should contact your servicer and ask that the extra amount not be applied to cover future payments. Otherwise, you may end up being paid ahead , and you can t receive credit for a qualifying PSLF payment during a month when no payment is due. \n\nWhat if I m in AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps, or my loans are being repaid by the U.S. Department of Defense? \nThere are special rules that allow borrowers who are AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteers to use their Segal Education Award or Peace Corps transition payment to make a single lump - sum payment that may count for up to 12 qualifying PSLF payments. In addition , borrowers who have lump - sum payments made on their behalf under a student loan repayment program administered by the U.S. Department of Defense may also receive credit for more than one qualifying PSLF payment. \n\nQualifying Repayment Plans \nQualifying repayment plans include all of the income - driven repayment IDR plans plans that base your monthly payment on your income. While payments made under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan are qualifying payments , you would have to change to an IDR plan to benefit from PSLF. Under the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan , your loans will be paid in full once you have made the 120 qualifying PSLF payments and there will be no balance to forgive. Before you change to an IDR plan , however , you should understand that your payment may increase under these plans depending on your income and the amount that you owe. If this is the case for you, and you do not wish to pay this higher amount , then the PSLF Program may not benefit you. The following repayment plans do not qualify for PSLF : Standard Repayment Plan for Direct Consolidation Loans Graduated Repayment Plan Extended Repayment Plan Alternative Repayment Plan \n\nPSLF Process \nBecause you have to make 120 qualifying monthly payments , it will take at least 10 years before you can qualify for PSLF. Important : You must be working for a qualifying employer at the time you submit the application for forgiveness and at the time the remaining balance on your loan is forgiven. If you are working toward PSLF , you should complete and submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Employment Certification Form often referred to as the ECF annually or when you change employers. If you have made 120 qualifying payments , you should fill out and submit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness: Application for Forgiveness PSLF application. Either way , we ll use the information you provide on the form to let you know if you are making qualifying PSLF payments. This will help you determine if you re on the right track as early as possible. Alert! If you don t periodically submit the Employment Certification Form , then at the time you apply for forgiveness , you will be required to submit an Employment Certification Form for each employer where you worked while making the required 120 qualifying monthly payments. \n\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Help Tool \nThe PSLF Help Tool will help you understand more about the PSLF Program and what you need to do to participate and possibly have your loans forgiven ; help you assess whether your employer qualifies for PSLF ; help you assess whether your loans qualify for PSLF ; help you decide which PSLF form to submit ; and use the information we have about your federal student loans to explain other actions you should or must take if you want to receive PSLF. At this time , the PSLF Help Tool won t allow you or your employer to electronically sign the forms that the tool will generate for you. Therefore , after you complete the PSLF Help Tool process , you will need to print the PDF document that the tool generates, sign it yourself, have your employer sign it, and then submit the form to the PSLF servicer as instructed on the printed PDF document. \n\nEmployment Certification Form Process \nAfter you submit an Employment Certification Form , your loans will transfer to the PSLF servicer. After the PSLF servicer determines how many qualifying payments you made during the period on your Employment Certification Form , you ll receive a letter telling you the number of qualifying payments you have made. The number of qualifying payments you have made will only be updated whenever you submit another Employment Certification Form or PSLF application that documents a new period of qualifying employment. You can find out how many qualifying payments you ve made by logging in to your account with the PSLF servicer and viewing your loan details or by looking on your most recent billing statement. \n\nEmployment Certification \nYour employment can be certified by an official who has access to your employment or service records and is authorized by your employer to certify your employment or your service as an AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteer. This will often be someone in the human resources department, though in some cases your direct supervisor or another individual may be authorized to certify your employment. Check with your organization to see who is allowed to certify your Employment Certification Form. \n\nTax on Forgiveness \nAmounts forgiven under the PSLF Program are not considered income by the Internal Revenue Service. Therefore , you will not have to pay federal income tax on the amount of your Direct Loans that is forgiven. \n\nHow to Submit PSLF Forms \nSend the completed form, with your employer s certification, to FedLoan Servicing, the U.S. Department of Education s federal loan servicer for the PSLF Program. You may mail the form to this address : U.S. Department of Education FedLoan Servicing P.O. Box 69184 Harrisburg, PA 17106 - 9184 You may also fax your PSLF application or Employment Certification Form to 717 - 720 - 1628.

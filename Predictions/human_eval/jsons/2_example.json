{"input": "Grad H: st\nGrad F: So we 're on .\nGrad H: Yeah . That 's better .\nGrad F: And , {comment} somewhere is my agenda . I think the most important thing is Morgan wanted to talk about , uh , the ARPA {pause} demo .\nProfessor D: Well , so , here 's the thing . Um , why don't we s again start off with {disfmarker} with , uh , Yeah , I 'll get it . I 'll get the door . Um , I think we want to start off with the agenda . And then , given that , uh , Liz and Andreas are gonna be {pause} ten , fifteen minutes late , we can try to figure out what we can do most effectively without them here . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} so , one thing is , yeah , talk about demo ,\nGrad F: OK . So , uh {disfmarker} uh , IBM transcription status ,\nProfessor D: IBM transcription . Uh , what else ?\nGrad F: \nProfessor D:  What 's SmartKom ? SmartKom ?\nGrad F: Uh , we wanna talk about if w if we wanna add the data to the mar Meeting Recorder corpus .\nPhD E: The data . The data which we are collecting here .\nProfessor D: What {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what are we collecting here ?\nPhD E: Data ?\nGrad F: So why don't we have that on the agenda and we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll get to it and talk about it ?\nPhD E: The SmartKom data ?\nProfessor D: Yeah , right .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Uh , right . Uh .\nGrad F: Uh , reorganization status .\nProfessor D: Reorganization status .\nPostdoc A: Oh . Files and directories ?\nProfessor D: Files and directories .\nGrad F: Yep . Uh - huh . Absinthe , which is the multiprocessor UNIX {disfmarker} Linux . I think it was {pause} Andreas wanted to talk about segmentation and recognition , and update on SRI recognition experiments .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker}\nGrad F: And then if ti if there 's time I wanted to talk about digits , but it looked like we were pretty full , so I can wait till next week .\nProfessor D: Right . OK . Well , let 's see . I think the a certainly the segmentation and recognition we wanna maybe focus on when An - Andreas is here since that was particularly his thing .\nPhD E: And also the SmartKom thing should b\nProfessor D: SmartKom also , Andreas . Absinthe , I think also he has sort of been involved in a lot of those things .\nGrad F: At least ,\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad F: yeah , he 'll t he 'll probably be interested .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad F: But .\nProfessor D: Um So , I mean , I think they 'll be inter I 'll be interested in all this , but {disfmarker} but , uh , probably , if we had to pick something {pause} that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they 're coming here . Or I guess it would be , you think , reorganization status , or {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Yeah . I mean , I think , Chuck was the one who added out the agenda item . I don't really have anything to say other than that we still haven't done it .\nPhD B: Well , I mean , I uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} just basically that {disfmarker}\nGrad F: So .\nPhD B: maybe I said {disfmarker} maybe we said this before {disfmarker} just that we met and we talked about it and we sort of have a plan for getting things organized and {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A: And I {disfmarker} and I think a crucial part of that is the idea of {disfmarker} of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back - up so that there won't be huge number of {disfmarker} of added ,\nPhD B: Right .\nPostdoc A: uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Right .\nPhD B: That {disfmarker} that was basically it . Not {disfmarker} not much @ @ {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Although Dave basically said that if we wanna do it , just tell him and he 'll do a d level zero then .\nPostdoc A: Yeah . Uh - huh . Oh , excellent .\nGrad F: So .\nPostdoc A: Oh , good .\nPhD B: Oh , so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready , and {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yep . So , I think we do need to talk a little bit about {disfmarker} Well , we don't need to do it during this meeting .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nGrad F: We have a little more to discuss . But , uh , we 're {disfmarker} we 're basically ready to do it . And , uh , I have some web pages on ts {comment} more of the background . So , naming conventions and things like that , that I 've been trying to keep actually up to date . So . And I 've been sharing them with U - d UW folks also .\nPostdoc A: I 'm sorry , you 've been what ? Showing them ?\nProfessor D: OK .\nPostdoc A: Sharing them .\nGrad F: Sharing them with the UW folks .\nPostdoc A: OK . OK .\nProfessor D: OK . Well , maybe uh , since that {disfmarker} that was a pretty short one , maybe we should talk about the IBM transcription status . Someone can {vocalsound} fill in Liz and Andreas later . Uh\nGrad F: OK . So , we , uh {disfmarker} we did another version of the beeps , where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit . Chuck came up here and recorded some di himself speaking some digits , and so it just goes \" beep one beep \" and then the phrase , and then \" beep two beep \" and then the phrase . And that seems pretty good . Um , I think they 'll have a b easier time keeping track of where they are in the file .\nPhD E: And we have done that on the {pause} automatic segmentations .\nGrad F: And we did it with the automatic segmentation , and I don't think {disfmarker} We ne we didn't look at it in detail . We just sent it to IBM . We {disfmarker} we sorta spot - checked it .\nPhD B: I listened to {pause} probably , uh , five or ten minutes of it from the beginning .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nGrad F: Oh , really ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nGrad F: OK .\nPhD B: And {disfmarker}\nGrad F: I sorta spot - checked here and there and it sounded pretty good . So . I think it 'll work .\nProfessor D: OK .\nGrad F: And , uh , we 'll just hafta see what we get back from them . Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD B: And the main thing will be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them . I mean , that 's the crucial part .\nGrad F: Right .\nPhD B: And I think we 'll be able to do that at {disfmarker} with this new beep format .\nGrad F: Yep . Well , I think it 's also they are much less likely to d have errors .\nPhD B: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: I mean , so the problem wi last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any , or {disfmarker} and they put in extraneous beeps .\nPhD B: Right . Yeah .\nGrad F: And with the numbers there , it 's much less likely .\nPhD B: Yeah , one interesting note is {disfmarker} uh , or problem {disfmarker} I dunno if this was just because of how I play it back , I say , uh , SND - play and then the file , every once in a while , @ @ {comment} uh , like a beep sounds like it 's cut into two beeps .\nPhD E: Yeah . Into two pieces .\nPhD B: Yeah , and I {disfmarker} I dunno if that 's an , uh , artifact of playback {disfmarker}\nPhD E: Yeah . Yep .\nPhD B: bu uh , I don't think it 's probably in the original file . Um , but , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD E: I recognize that , too . Yeah .\nGrad F: Ha . That 's interesting . I didn't hear that .\nPhD B: Yeah . But with this new format , um , that hopefully they 're not hearing that , and if they are , it shouldn't throw them .\nPhD E: Yep .\nPhD B: So .\nGrad F: Well , maybe we better listen to it again , make sure , but , I mean , certainly the software shouldn't do that ,\nPhD B: Yeah . That 's what I thought .\nGrad F: so .\nPostdoc A: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: I it 's probably just , you know , mmm , somehow the audio {pause} device gets hung for a second ,\nPhD E: Yeah . Some latency or something .\nGrad F: Hiccups .\nPhD E: Yeah ?\nPostdoc A: As long as they have one number , and they know that there 's only one beep maximum {vocalsound} that goes with that number .\nPhD B: or {disfmarker}\nPhD E: Yeah .\nPhD B: Yeah . Right .\nGrad F: Yeah . The only {disfmarker} the only part that might be confusing is when Chuck is reading digits .\nPhD B: Right .\nPhD E: Yep .\nPostdoc A: Well , you know , actually , are we having them {disfmarker}\nPhD B: So {vocalsound} th\nGrad F: \" Seven four eight beep seven beep {vocalsound} eight three two \" .\nPostdoc A: Yeah , but are we having them do digits ?\nGrad F: Yes . Because , uh , we don't {disfmarker} we didn't {disfmarker} In order to cut them out we 'd have to listen to it .\nPhD B: We {disfmarker} we didn't cut those out .\nPhD E: Yeah . They are not transcribed yet . So . Yeah .\nPostdoc A: OK .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nGrad F: And we wanted to avoid doing that ,\nPostdoc A: OK .\nGrad F: so we {disfmarker} they are transcribing the digits .\nPostdoc A: OK .\nPhD B: We can {disfmarker} we can ignore it when we get it back ,\nGrad F: Although we could tell them {disfmarker} {comment} {vocalsound} we could tell them , if you hear someone reading a digits string just say \" bracket digit bracket \"\nPhD B: huh .\nGrad F: and don't bother actually computing the di writing down the digits .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPostdoc A: That 'd be great . That 'd be what I 'm having the transcribers here do , cuz it can be extracted later .\nGrad F: Yep . And then I wanted to talk about {disfmarker} but as I said I {disfmarker} we may not have time {disfmarker} what we should do about digits . We have a whole pile of digits that haven't been transcribed .\nProfessor D: Le - let 's talk about it , because that 's {disfmarker} that 's something that I {disfmarker} I know Andreas is less interested in than Liz is ,\nGrad F: OK .\nProfessor D: so , you know . It 's good {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Do we have anything else to say about transcription ? About IBM stuff ?\nPhD B: Uh , Brian {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {vocalsound} sent bresset {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} sent Brian a message about {pause} {vocalsound} the meeting and I haven't heard back yet . So . I g hope he got it and hopefully he 's {disfmarker}\nGrad F: OK .\nPostdoc A: Hmm .\nPhD B: maybe he 's gone , I dunno . He didn't even reply to my message . So . I should probably ping him just to make sure that he got it . \nGrad F: Alright . So , we have a whole bunch of digits , if we wanna move on to digits .\nProfessor D: Actually , maybe I {disfmarker} One {disfmarker} one relate more related thing in transcription . So that 's the IBM stuff . We 've got that sorted out . Um , how 're we doing on the {disfmarker} on the rest of it ?\nPostdoc A: We 're doing well . I {disfmarker} I hire {disfmarker} I 've hired two extra people already , expect to hire two more .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPostdoc A: And , um , {vocalsound} I 've prepared , um , uh , a set of five which I 'm {disfmarker} which I 'm calling set two , which are now being edited by my head transcriber , {vocalsound} in terms of spelling errors and all that . She 's also checking through and mar and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and monitoring , um , the transcription of another transcriber . You know , I mean , she 's going through and doing these kinds of checks .\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPostdoc A: And , I 've moved on now to what I 'm calling set three . I sort of thought if I do it in sets {disfmarker} groups of five , then I can have , like , sort of a {disfmarker} a parallel processing through {disfmarker} through the {disfmarker} the current .\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPostdoc A: And {disfmarker} and you indicated to me that we have a g a goal now , {vocalsound} for the {disfmarker} for the , um , {nonvocalsound} {vocalsound} the , uh , DARPA demo , of twenty hours . So , I 'm gonna go up to twenty hours , be sure that everything gets processed , and released , and {disfmarker} {pause} {comment} and that 's {disfmarker} that 's what my goal is . Package of twenty hours right now , {vocalsound} and then once that 's done , move on to the next .\nProfessor D: Yeah , uh , so twenty hours . But I guess the other thing is that , um , that {disfmarker} that 's kinda twenty hours ASAP because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hours , the more time it 'll be for people to actually do cool things with it .\nPostdoc A: Mm - hmm . Good . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm hiring people who , {vocalsound} uh , really are {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: So . OK .\nPostdoc A: They would like to do it full - time , several of these people . And {disfmarker} and I don't think it 's {vocalsound} possible , really , to do this full - time , but , that {disfmarker} what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: It 'll keep your accuracy up . Yep .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPostdoc A: And they 're really excellent .\nProfessor D: Yeah . Well , that 's good .\nPostdoc A: Yeah . Got a good core group now .\nProfessor D: Yeah , I mean , I guess the {disfmarker} So the difference if {disfmarker} if , um , if the IBM stuff works out , the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else ?\nPostdoc A: Again . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Is that most of what it {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: And correcting .\nProfessor D: I mean {disfmarker} Correcting .\nGrad F: Correcting . We 'll {disfmarker} we 'll expect that they 'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections .\nPostdoc A: And I {disfmarker} you know , I 've also d uh , discovered {disfmarker} So with the new transcriber I 'm {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Uh , lemme say that my , uh {disfmarker} So , um {disfmarker} At present , um , the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time . And , that sort of , um , {vocalsound} is useful , and t you know , and then once in a while they 'll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up . OK . Well , {vocalsound} I realize that , um , w i we we 're using the pre - segmented version , and , um , the pre - segmented version is extremely useful , and wouldn't it be , useful also to have the visual representation of those segments ? And so I 've {disfmarker} {pause} uh , {pause} I , uh , uh , I 've {comment} trained the new one {disfmarker} uh , the new the newest one , {vocalsound} to , um , {vocalsound} use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time . And that 's just amazingly helpful . Because what happens then , is you scan across the signal and once in a while you 'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre - segmentation .\nGrad F: Oh , right .\nPostdoc A: And that 'll be something like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I it 's ver {disfmarker} it 's interesting .\nGrad F: I see what you mean . A backchannel , or {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A: Once in a while it 's a backchannel .\nPhD E: Yep .\nPostdoc A: Sometimes it seems to be , um , similar to the ones that are being picked up .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nPostdoc A: And they 're rare events , but you can really go through a meeting very quickly . You just {disfmarker} you just , you know , yo you s you scroll from screen to screen , looking for blips . And , I think that we 're gonna end up with , uh {pause} better coverage of the backchannels ,\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPostdoc A: but at the same time we 're benefitting tremendously from the pre - segmentation because {vocalsound} there are huge places where there is just absolutely no activity at all . And , uh , the audio quality is so good {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: So they can {disfmarker} they can , um , scroll through that pretty quick ?\nPostdoc A: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nPhD B: That 's great .\nPostdoc A: Yeah . So I think that that 's gonna , also {pause} eh , {comment} you know , speed the efficiency of this part of the process .\nProfessor D: Hmm . OK . Uh , yeah . So , uh {disfmarker} Yeah . So let 's talk about the digits , since they 're not here yet .\nGrad F: Uh , so , we have a whole bunch of digits that we 've read and we have the forms and so on , um , but only a small number of that ha well , not a small number {disfmarker} only a subset of that has been transcribed . And so we need to decide what we wanna do . And , uh , Liz and Andreas {disfmarker} actually they 're not here , but , they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment . And , again , I don't think we 'll be able to do with that alone , because , um , sometimes people correct themselves and things like that . But {disfmarker} so , I was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits , doing a forced alignment , and doing the timing .\nProfessor D: Well , forced alignment would be one thing . What about just actually doing recognition ?\nGrad F: Well , we {disfmarker} we know what they read , because we have the forms .\nProfessor D: No , they make mistakes .\nGrad F: Right . But , the point is that we wanna get a set of clean digits .\nPhD B: You 're talking about as a pre - processing step .\nProfessor D: Right .\nPhD B: Right , Morgan ?\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker}\nPhD B: Is that what you 're {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor D: Yeah , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not quite sure what I 'm talking about . I mean {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , uh , we 're talking about digits now . And {disfmarker} and so , um , there 's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been marked yet . Uh . And , um , {vocalsound} there 's the issue that {disfmarker} that they {disfmarker} we know what {disfmarker} what was said , but do we ?\nGrad F: I mean , so one option i\nProfessor D: Because people make mistakes and stuff . I was just asking , just out of curiosity , if {disfmarker} if with , uh {disfmarker} uh , the SRI recognizer getting one percent word error , uh , would we {disfmarker} would we do {pause} better {disfmarker} ? So , if you do a forced alignment but the force but the {disfmarker} but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes , uh , or {vocalsound} false starts , it 's {disfmarker} it 's much less c {vocalsound} it 's {pause} much less common than one percent ?\nGrad F: But that 's pretty uncommon . Um , if we could really get one percent on {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: We should be able to .\nGrad F: Well , I guess {disfmarker} yeah , I guess if we segmented it , we could get one percent on digits .\nProfessor D: Right ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah . So that 's just my question . I 'm not saying it should be one way or the other , but it 's {disfmarker} If {disfmarker}\nGrad F: But , Well , there {disfmarker} there 're a couple different of doing it . We could use the tools I 've already developed and transcribe it . Hire some people , or use the transcribers to do it . We could let IBM transcribe it . You know , they 're doing it anyway , and unless we tell them different , they 're gonna transcribe it . Um , or we could try some automated methods .\nProfessor D: Well {disfmarker}\nGrad F: And my {disfmarker} my tendency right now is , well , if IBM comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good , just let them do it .\nProfessor D: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} Y you raised a point , kind of , uh , euphemistically {disfmarker} but , I mean , m maybe it is a serious problem . Ho - what will they do when they go {disfmarker} hear \" beep {pause} seven {pause} beep {pause} seven three five two \" {disfmarker} I mean , {vocalsound} you think they 'll {disfmarker} we 'll get {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: It 's pretty distinct .\nProfessor D: Yeah ?\nGrad F: The beeps are {pause} pre - recorded .\nPhD B: It 'll {comment} only be a problem for m for mine .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nPostdoc A: Well it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} well , it 'd be preceded by \" I 'm reading transcript so - and - so \" ?\nPhD B: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yes .\nPostdoc A: So , I think if they 're processing it at {disfmarker}\nGrad F: I mean , it 'll be {disfmarker} it will be in the midst of a digit string .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad F: So {disfmarker} I mean it {disfmarker} sure , there {disfmarker} there might be a place where it 's \" beep seven {pause} beep eight {pause} beep {pause} eight {pause} beep \" . But , you know , they {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're gonna macros for inserting the beep marks . And so , I {disfmarker} I don't think it 'll be a problem . We 'll have to see , but I don't think it 's gonna be a problem .\nProfessor D: OK . Well , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I dunno , I {disfmarker} I think that that 's {disfmarker} if they are in fact going to transcribe these things , uh , certainly any process that we 'd have to correct them , or whatever is {disfmarker} needs to be much less elaborate for digits than for other stuff .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor D: So , why not ? Sure . That was it ?\nGrad F: That was it . Just , what do we do with digits ?\nProfessor D: OK .\nGrad F: We have so many of them , {vocalsound} and it 'd be nice to {pause} actually do something with them .\nProfessor D: Well , we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we wanna have them . Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nPhD I: You mean there 're more than ten ?\nGrad F: Anything else ? Your mike is a little low there .\nProfessor D: I in Berkeley , yeah . So , {vocalsound} uh {pause} You {disfmarker} you have to go a little early , right ? At twenty {disfmarker}\nPhD I: Well , I can stay till about , uh , three forty .\nProfessor D: Alright . So le let 's make sure we do the ones that {disfmarker} that , uh , saved you .\nPhD I: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: So there was some {disfmarker} Uh {pause} {vocalsound} In {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} Adam 's agenda list , he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition ?\nPhD I: Well , yeah . So this is just partly to inform everybody , um , and {disfmarker} and of course to get , um , input .\nGrad F: Oops .\nPhD I: Um , so , {nonvocalsound} uh , we had a discussion {disfmarker} Don and Liz and I had discussion last week about how to proceed with , uh , you know , with Don 's work ,\nPhD E: Ch\nPhD I: and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} and , uh , one of the obvious things that occur to us was that we 're {disfmarker} since we now have Thilo 's segmenter and it works , you know , amazingly well , {vocalsound} um , we should actually basically re - evaluate the recognition , um , results using {disfmarker} you know , without cheating on the segmentations .\nPhD E: So {disfmarker}\nPhD I: And , that should be fairly {disfmarker}\nPhD E: And how do we find the transcripts for those so that {disfmarker} ? Yeah . The references for {disfmarker} for {pause} those segments ?\nPhD I: Oh , OK . So , there 's actually {disfmarker}\nPhD E: It 's not that {disfmarker}\nPhD I: Why do you ask ?\nGrad F: I could {disfmarker}\nPhD I: No , actually , um , NIST has , um m a fairly sophisticated scoring program {vocalsound} that you can give a , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a time ,\nGrad F: Hand ones .\nPhD G: Well {disfmarker}\nPhD E: OK .\nPhD I: uh {disfmarker} You know , you basically just give two {pause} time - marked sequences of words , and it computes the um {disfmarker} the , {comment} uh {disfmarker} {comment} you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} th\nPhD B: It does all the work for you .\nPhD I: it does all the work for you .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD E: OK .\nPhD I: So , it {disfmarker} we just {disfmarker} and we use that actually in Hub - five to do the scoring . Um . So what we 've been using so far was sort of a {pause} simplified version of the scoring . And we can {disfmarker} we can handle the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the type of problem we have here .\nPhD E: So , basically you give some time constraints for {disfmarker} for the references and for {disfmarker} for the hypothesis ,\nPhD I: So , we ha Yeah . Right .\nPhD E: and {disfmarker} Yeah , OK .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD I: Right .\nPhD G: Maybe the {pause} start of your speech and the end of it ,\nPhD I: So do\nPhD E: OK .\nPhD G: or stuff like that .\nPhD I: Right . It does time - constrained word - alignment .\nPhD E: OK .\nPhD I: So . So that should be possible . I mean that shouldn't be a problem . Uh , so that was the one thing , and the other was that , um {disfmarker} What was the other problem ? Oh ! That Thilo wanted to use {pause} the recognizer alignments to train up his , um , speech detector .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nPhD I: Um , so that we could use , uh {disfmarker} you know there wouldn't be so much hand {vocalsound} labelling needed to , uh {disfmarker} to generate training data for {disfmarker} for the speech detector .\nPhD E: Yeah . I 'm just in progress of {disfmarker} of doing that . So .\nPhD I: And I think you 're in the process of doing that .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nPhD I: So , you can {disfmarker} {comment} you can {disfmarker}\nPhD B: It 'll give you a lot more data , too . Won't it ?\nPhD E: Yeah . So , it 's basically {disfmarker} s I think , eight meetings or something which {disfmarker} which I 'm using , and , {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} before it was twenty minutes of one meeting .\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nPhD E: So {disfmarker} should {comment} be a little bit better .\nPhD I: Right .\nPhD B: Great .\nPhD I: That won't be perfect {disfmarker} the alignments aren't perfect ,\nPhD E: Yeah . But {disfmarker}\nPhD I: but , um , it 's probably still better to have all this extra data , than {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD E: Yeah . Yep .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nPhD E: We 'll see that .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD G: Actually , I had a question about that . If you find that you can {vocalsound} lower the false alarms that you get where there 's no speech , that would be useful {pause} for us to know . So , um {disfmarker}\nPhD E: There were the false alarms .\nPhD G: Yeah . So , {vocalsound} r right now you get f fal you know , false {disfmarker} false , uh , speech regions when it 's just like , um , {vocalsound} breath or something like that ,\nPhD E: OK . Yeah . Yep .\nPhD G: and I 'd be interested to know the {disfmarker} wha if you retrain um ,\nPhD E: Yeah .\nPhD G: do those actually go down or not ? Because {pause} of {disfmarker}\nPhD E: Yeah . I 'll {disfmarker} can make {disfmarker} an can , like , make a c comparison of {disfmarker} of the old system to the {disfmarker} to the new one , and {pause} then {disfmarker}\nPhD G: Yeah , just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of {disfmarker} just having that training data wh what happens .\nPhD E: Yeah . Yeah . Yep .\nProfessor D: Um another one that we had on Adam 's agenda {pause} that definitely involved you was s something about SmartKom ?\nGrad F: Right . So , Rob Porzel {disfmarker} eh , Porzel ? and the , uh {disfmarker} Porzel {disfmarker} and the , uh , SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues .\nPhD I: Porzel . Porzel .\nGrad F: Basically they have one person sitting in here , looking at a picture , and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere . And , uh , they 're doing a travel task . And , uh , it involves starting {disfmarker} I believe starting with a {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} it 's always the wizard , but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a , uh , {vocalsound} speech generation system .\nPhD E: Yeah . Actually , it 's changed to a synthesis for {disfmarker} for the first part now .\nGrad F: Synthesis system .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nGrad F: Um , and then , it goes to a real wizard and they 're evaluating that . And they wanted to use this equipment , and so the w question came up , is {disfmarker} well , here 's some more data . Should this be part of the corpus or not ? And my attitude was yes , because there might be people who are using this corpus for {pause} acoustics , as opposed to just for language . Um , or also for dialogue of various sorts . Um , so it 's not a meeting . Right ? Because it 's two people and they 're not face to face .\nProfessor D: Wait a minute . So , I just wanted to understand it , cuz I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} uh , hadn't quite followed this process .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Um . So , it 's wizard in the sen usual sense that the person who is asking the questions doesn't know that it 's , uh , a machi not a machine ?\nPhD I: Right .\nGrad F: At the beginning .\nPhD I: Actually {disfmarker} actually , w w the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} We do this {disfmarker} I dunno who came up with it , but I think it 's a really clever idea . We simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session , and so then after that , the person 's told that they 're now talking to a , uh {disfmarker} to a human .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD E: It 's a human operator .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nGrad F: But of course they don't know that it 's the same person both times .\nPhD I: So , we {disfmarker} we collect {disfmarker} we collect both human - computer and human - human data , essentially , in the same session .\nProfessor D: You might wanna try collecting it the other way around sometime , saying that th the computer isn't up yet\nPostdoc A: Hmm .\nProfessor D: and then {disfmarker} so then you can separate it out whether it 's the beginning or end kind of effects .\nPhD I: That 's an idea .\nProfessor D: But , yeah .\nGrad F: Yep .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nPostdoc A: That 's a good idea .\nGrad F: \" I have to go now . You can talk to the computer . \"\nPhD B: It 's a lot more believable , too ,\nGrad F: \" No ! \"\nPhD B: if you tell them that they 're {disfmarker} the computer part is running on a Windows machine . And the whole breakdown thing kinda makes sense .\nPhD I: O Just {disfmarker} just reboot it .\nGrad F: Abort {disfmarker} abort , retry , fail ?\nPhD G: So did they actually save the far - field {pause} data ?\nPhD E: Yes .\nGrad F: Well , this was {disfmarker} this was the question .\nPhD G: Cuz at first they weren't {disfmarker} they weren't sa\nPhD I: Yeah .\nGrad F: So {disfmarker} so they were saying they were not going to ,\nPhD E: Yeah .\nPhD G: OK .\nGrad F: and I said , \" well that 's silly , if {disfmarker} if we 're gonna try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . \"\nPhD G: Yeah .\nPhD I: Wow .\nPhD E: No .\nPhD G: Or {disfmarker}\nPhD E: projector {comment} We were not saying we are not {pause} doing it .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nProfessor D: S\nPhD E: We wer we just wanted to do {disfmarker}\nPhD I: No , the {disfmarker} the question is do we save one or two far - field channels or all of them ?\nPhD G: Right .\nPhD E: Yeah . Yeah .\nGrad F: I {disfmarker} I see no reason not to do all of them .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker}\nGrad F: That {disfmarker} that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies , uh , it 's nice to have the same for every recording .\nPhD G: Nnn . Yeah .\nPhD I: Hmm .\nProfessor D: So , what is the purpose of this recording ?\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: This is to get acoustic and language model training data for SmartKom. OK .\nPhD I: It 's to be traini to b training data and development data for the SmartKom {pause} system .\nPhD E: The English system ? Yeah .\nPhD I: Yeah . Right . Right .\nPhD B: Where does this {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor D: \nPhD G: Maybe we can have him vary the microphones , too ,\nProfessor D: Well ,\nPhD E: B\nPhD G: or they 're different s speakers .\nGrad F: Right . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so for their usage , they don't need anything .\nProfessor D: so why not {disfmarker} ?\nPhD E: Yeah .\nGrad F: Right ?\nPhD E: But {disfmarker} but I 'm not sure about the legal aspect of {disfmarker} of that . Is {disfmarker} is there some contract with SmartKom or something about the data ?\nPhD I: Yeah .\nPhD E: What they {disfmarker} or , is {disfmarker} is that our data which we are collecting here ,\nProfessor D: We 've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use anything that we did .\nPhD E: or {disfmarker} ? OK . OK .\nPhD I: We weren't supposed to collect any data .\nPhD E: So . OK .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD E: So . Yeah , th th that was the question .\nPhD I: This was all {disfmarker}\nPhD E: If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nProfessor D: No that 's not a problem .\nPhD E: Basically .\nProfessor D: I {disfmarker} L look , it seems to me that if we 're doing it anyway and we 're doing it for these {disfmarker} these purposes that we have , {vocalsound} and we have these distant mikes , we definitely should re should save it all as long as we 've got disk space ,\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: and disk is pretty cheap .\nPhD I: OK .\nProfessor D: So should we save it ?\nGrad F: And then {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Now th Yeah . So we save it because it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's potentially useful . And now , what do we do with it is {disfmarker} is a s separate question .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor D: I mean , anybody who 's training something up could {vocalsound} choose to put it {disfmarker} eh , to u include this or not .\nPhD I: Right .\nProfessor D: I {disfmarker} I would not say it was part of the meetings corpus . It isn't . But it 's some other data we have , and if somebody doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can . Right ?\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: So it 's {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} I guess it {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} begs the question of what is the meeting corpus . So if , at UW they start recording two - person hallway conversations is that part of the meeting corpus ?\nProfessor D: I think it 's {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key .\nGrad F: Well , this has two or more people conversing with each other .\nProfessor D: Nnn , well\nPhD E: Yeah .\nPostdoc A: Well this {disfmarker}\nGrad F: They 're just not face to face .\nPhD G: What if we just give it a {disfmarker} a name like we give these meetings a name ?\nProfessor D: No , it doesn't . Right ? It has {disfmarker}\nGrad F: I mean , that was my intention .\nPhD G: And then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people won't ,\nPostdoc A: Well this {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad F: That was my intention . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} s {vocalsound} so part of the reason that I wanted to bring this up is , {vocalsound} do we wanna handle it as a special case or do we wanna fold it in ,\nPhD G: and {disfmarker} Just give it a {vocalsound} title .\nPostdoc A: Oh .\nProfessor D: I think it is a s\nGrad F: we give everyone who 's involved as their own user ID , give it session I Ds , {vocalsound} let all the tools that handle Meeting Recorder handle it , or do we wanna special case it ? And if we were gonna special case it , who 's gonna do that ?\nPhD E: So .\nPhD I: Well , it {disfmarker} it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure , since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily .\nPhD E: It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A: I think {disfmarker}\nPhD I: But as far as distributing it , we shouldn't label it as part of this meeting corpus .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD I: We should let it be its own corp\nPostdoc A: Well it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} well , because {disfmarker}\nGrad F: I don't see why not . It 's just a different topic .\nPostdoc A: I ha I have an extra point , which is the naturalness issue . Because we have , like , meetings that have a reason . That 's one of the reasons that we were talking about this . And {disfmarker} and those {disfmarker} and this sounds like it 's more of an experimental setup .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPostdoc A: It 's got a different purpose .\nProfessor D: It 's scenario - based , it 's {disfmarker} it 's human - computer interface {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's really pretty different .\nPostdoc A: Yeah .\nProfessor D: But I I {disfmarker} I have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they 're gonna do , but I don't think i it {disfmarker} it doesn't match anything that we 've described about meetings .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Whereas everything that we talked about them doing at {disfmarker} at UW and so forth really does . They 're actually talking {disfmarker}\nGrad F: OK . So w so what does that mean for how we are gonna organize things ?\nPostdoc A: Hmm .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nProfessor D: You can {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker} Again , as {disfmarker} as I think Andreas was saying , {vocalsound} if you wanna use the same tools and the same conventions , there 's no problem with that . It 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's {disfmarker} you know . It is different . You can't just fold it in as if it 's {disfmarker} I mean , digits are different , too . Right ?\nGrad F: Yeah , but those are folded in ,\nPhD I: It might also be potentially confusing .\nGrad F: and it 's just {disfmarker} you just mark the transcripts differently . So {disfmarker} so one option is you fold it in ,\nPhD I: Right .\nGrad F: and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction .\nPhD I: Yeah , I th\nProfessor D: Well , I don I wouldn't call reading digits \" meetings \" . Right ? I mean , we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we were doing {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Well , but {disfmarker} but , {vocalsound} I put it under the same directory tree .\nProfessor D: Well {disfmarker}\nGrad F: You know , it 's in \" user doctor speech data MR \" .\nPhD G: Can we just have a directory called , like , \" other stuff \" ?\nGrad F: Other .\nPhD G: And {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} or , I dunno .\nProfessor D: I mean , I don't care what directory tree you have it under .\nPhD G: And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and just , um , store it there .\nProfessor D: Right ? I mean that 's just a {disfmarker}\nGrad F: OK . My preference is to have a single procedure so that I don't have to think too much about things .\nPhD I: Yes .\nPhD G: I mean {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad F: And , just have a marking .\nProfessor D: O - You {disfmarker} you can use whatever procedure you want that 's p convenient for you .\nGrad F: If we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure , and someone has to do that .\nProfessor D: All I 'm saying is that there 's no way that we 're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings . And similarly we 're not gonna tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings .\nGrad F: Right .\nProfessor D: Those aren't meetings . But if it makes it easier for you to pu fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree , knock yourself out .\nPhD B: There 's a couple other questions that I have too ,\nProfessor D: You know ?\nPhD B: and {disfmarker} and {pause} one of them is , what about , uh , consent issues ? And the other one is , what about transcription ? Are {disfmarker} ?\nPhD E: Transcription is done in Munich .\nPhD B: OK . So we don't have to worry about transcribing it ?\nProfessor D: Alright .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nGrad F: So , w we will hafta worry about format .\nPhD I: That 's a {disfmarker} that 's another argument to keep it separate , because it 's gonna follow the SmartKom transcription conventions and not the ICSI meeting transcription conventions .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nGrad F: Oh , OK .\nProfessor D: Ah . Good point .\nGrad F: OK . Well , I didn't realize that . That 's {disfmarker} that 's a {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Good point . But I 'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or {disfmarker} or some things . Um . Do we h do we have , uh , um , American - born folk , uh , reading German {disfmarker} German , uh , pla uh , place names and so forth ? Is that {disfmarker} ?\nPhD E: Yeah .\nPhD I: Exactly .\nProfessor D: Yeah , great .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yep .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nGrad F: They {disfmarker} they even have a reading list .\nPhD B: I bet that sounds good , huh ?\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad F: It 's pretty funny .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nPhD E: You can do that if you want .\nPhD B: OK .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD B: I dunno if you want that .\nProfessor D: Right .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nPostdoc A: Hmm .\nProfessor D: Heidelberg\nGrad F: So {disfmarker}\nPhD I: Exactly\nGrad F: Disk might eventually be an issue so we might {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we might need to , uh , {vocalsound} get some more disk pretty soon .\nPhD I: Do you wanna be a subject ?\nProfessor D: Yeah , I be pretty good .\nPhD I: We {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad F: We 're about {disfmarker} we 're about half {disfmarker} halfway through our disk right now .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD I: That was one of our concerns .\nPhD B: Are we only half ? I thought we were more than that .\nGrad F: We 're probably a little more than that because we 're using up some space that we shouldn't be on . So , once everything gets converted over to the disks we 're supposed to be using we 'll be probably , uh , seventy - five percent .\nPhD B: Well , when I was looking for space for Thilo , I found one disk that had , uh , I think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen .\nGrad F: Yep .\nPhD B: And everything else was sorta committed . Uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Were those backed - up or non - backed - up ?\nPhD B: Those were non - backed - up .\nPhD E: Non - back - up .\nGrad F: Right . So that 's different .\nPhD B: S oh , you 're talking about backed - up .\nGrad F: I 'm much more concerned about the backed - up . The non - backed - up ,\nPhD B: I haven't looked to see how much of that we have .\nGrad F: yeah , i is cheap . I mean , if we need to we can buy a disk , hang it off a s uh , workstation . If it 's not backed - up the sysadmins don't care too much .\nProfessor D: Yeah . So , I mean , pretty much anytime we need a disk , we can get it at the rate that we 're {disfmarker}\nPhD I: You can {disfmarker} I shouldn't be saying this , but , you can just {disfmarker} you know , since the back - ups are every night , you can recycle the backed - up diskspace .\nGrad F: Yeah . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} {pause} that 's risky .\nProfessor D: Yeah . You really shouldn't be saying {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Mmm . Mmm .\nPhD I: I didn't say that .\nGrad F: Yeah , that 's right .\nPhD I: I didn't say that .\nGrad F: Beep that out .\nProfessor D: Da - we had allowed Dave to listen to these {disfmarker} {vocalsound} these , {vocalsound} uh , recordings .\nPhD I: Right .\nProfessor D: Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , I me and there 's been this conversation going on about getting another file server , and {disfmarker} and {vocalsound} we can do that .\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: We 'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of disk , I guess .\nGrad F: Yeah . It 's really the back - up issue rather than the file server issue .\nPhD I: Well , I think {disfmarker} {comment} I think there 's an argument for having {disfmarker} you know , you could use our old file server for {disfmarker} for disks that have data that {pause} is very rarely accessed , and then have a fast new file server for data that is , um , heavily accessed .\nGrad F: Yeah . My understanding is , the issue isn't really the file server .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nGrad F: We could always put more disks on .\nPhD I: Yeah . It 's the back it 's the back - up capaci\nGrad F: It 's the back - up system .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nGrad F: So {disfmarker} which is near saturation , apparently . So .\nPhD B: I think {disfmarker} I think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines .\nProfessor D: Soon .\nPhD B: And we 've got , you know , fifty machines trying to access data off of Abbott at once .\nGrad F: Well , we 're alright for now because the network 's so slow .\nPhD I: I mean , I think {disfmarker} I think we 've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it , but the {disfmarker} What about putting the stuff on , like , C - CD - ROM or DVD or something ?\nGrad F: Yeah . That was me . I was the one who said it was not reliable . The - they {disfmarker} they wear out .\nPhD I: OK . Oh , OK .\nGrad F: Yeah . The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} th\nPhD I: But they wear out just from sitting on the shelf ?\nGrad F: Yep . Absolutely .\nPhD I: Or from being {pause} read and read ?\nGrad F: No . Read and write don't hurt them too much unless you scratch them .\nPhD I: Oh , OK .\nGrad F: But the r the write once , and the read - writes , don't last . So you don't wa you don't wanna put ir un reproduceable data {pause} on them .\nPhD I: Uh - huh .\nPhD B: Wear out after what amount of time ?\nGrad F: Year or two .\nPostdoc A: Would it be {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor D: Year or two ?\nGrad F: Yep .\nProfessor D: Wow .\nPostdoc A: Hmm .\nPhD I: But if that {disfmarker} then you would think you 'd {pause} hear much more clamoring about data loss\nPhD E: Yeah .\nPhD I: and {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: I mean , yeah , all the L\nGrad F: I {disfmarker} I don't know many people who do it on CD . I mean , they 're {disfmarker} the most {disfmarker} fo\nProfessor D: LDC - all the LDC distributions are on CD - ROM .\nPhD G: Yeah .\nGrad F: They 're on CD , but they 're not {disfmarker} tha that 's not the only source .\nPhD G: Like {disfmarker}\nGrad F: They have them on disk . And they burn new ones every once in a while . But if you go {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you go k\nPhD I: But , you know , we have {disfmarker}\nPhD G: But we have like thirty {pause} you know , from {pause} ten years ago ?\nProfessor D: We have all sorts of CD - ROMs from a long time ago .\nPhD G: No .\nPhD E: Yeah .\nPhD G: Yeah !\nGrad F: Well , th th OK .\nPhD G: Ten years ago .\nPhD I: Right .\nPhD G: Ninety - one , and they 're still all fine .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad H: Were they burned or were they pressed ?\nPhD G: Uh , both . I 've burned them and they 're still OK .\nGrad H: Yeah .\nGrad F: The {disfmarker} the pressed ones last for\nPhD G: I mean , usually they 're {disfmarker}\nGrad F: well , not forever , they 've been finding even those degrade .\nProfessor D: Oh , I see .\nGrad F: But , uh , the burned ones {disfmarker} I mean , when I say two or three years what I 'm saying is that I have had disks which are gone in a year .\nPhD G: That 's what I {disfmarker}\nGrad F: On the average , it 'll probably be three or four years . But , uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} you don't want to per p have your only copy on a media that fails .\nPhD I: Mmm .\nGrad F: And they do . Um , if you have them professionally pressed , y you know , they 're good for decades .\nPhD I: So how about {disfmarker} ? So {disfmarker} so how about putting them on that plus , like on a {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on DAT or some other medium that isn't risky ?\nGrad F: I think th um , we can already put them on tape . And the tape is hi is very reliable .\nPhD I: OK . Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: So the {disfmarker} the only issue is then {pause} if we need access to them . So that 's fine f if we don't need access to them .\nPhD I: Right . Well , if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} if they last {disfmarker} Say , they actually last , like , five years , huh , in {disfmarker} in the typical case , and {disfmarker} and occasionally you might need to recreate one , and then you get your tape out , but otherwise you don't . Can't you just {disfmarker} you just put them on {disfmarker} ?\nGrad H: So you just archive it on the tape , and then put it on CD as well ?\nPhD I: Yeah . Right .\nGrad F: Oh . So you 're just saying put them on C Ds for normal access .\nGrad H: Yeah .\nPhD I: Right .\nPhD B: What you {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah . I mean , you can do that but that 's pretty annoying , because the C Ds are so slow .\nPhD G: See {disfmarker} Yeah .\nGrad H: Yeah .\nPhD I: Mmm .\nPhD B: What 'd be nice is a system that re - burned the C Ds every {vocalsound} year .\nPhD G: H everytime it was a \" gonna \" {disfmarker} \" gonna die \" .\nProfessor D: Well {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Well , I mean , the C Ds are {disfmarker} are an op\nPhD E: Yeah .\nPhD I: It 's like {disfmarker} like dynamic ra DRAM .\nPhD E: Just before .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nPhD G: Just before they be before it goes bad , it burns them in .\nGrad F: The {disfmarker} the CD is an alternative to tape .\nGrad H: Yeah .\nGrad F: ICSI already has a perfectly good tape system and it 's more reliable .\nProfessor D: You know {disfmarker} I would think {disfmarker}\nGrad F: So for archiving , we 'll just use tape .\nPhD I: One {disfmarker} one thing I don't understand is , if you have the data {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you if the meeting data is put on disk exactly once , then it 's backed - up once and the back - up system should never have to bother with it , uh , more than once .\nGrad F: Well , regardless {disfmarker} Well , first of all there was , um , a problem with the archive in that I was every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directories an or recursive chmod and chown , because {vocalsound} they weren't getting set correctly every once in a while ,\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: and I was just , {vocalsound} doing a minus R star , {vocalsound} not realizing that that caused {pause} it to be re - backed - up .\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nPhD G: Ah .\nGrad F: But normally you 're correct . But even without that , the back - up system is becoming saturated .\nPhD I: But {disfmarker} but this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be {pause} backed - up again .\nProfessor D: The b I think th the {disfmarker} at least the once tha that you put it on , it would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it would {comment} {vocalsound} kill that .\nGrad F: Sure , but we still have enough changed that the nightly back - ups are starting to take too long .\nPhD I: OK . So {disfmarker} so then , if {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so then , let 's {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: So .\nGrad F: It has nothing to do with the meeting . It 's just the general ICSI back - up system is becoming saturated .\nPhD I: Right . OK . Right . So , what if we buy , uh {disfmarker} uh , what {disfmarker} what do they call these , um {pause} high density {disfmarker} ?\nGrad F: Well , why don't you have this {disfmarker} have a {disfmarker} this conversation with Dave Johnson tha rather than with me ?\nPhD I: No , no . Because this is {pause} maybe something that we can do without involving Dave , and {disfmarker} and , putting more burden on him . How about we buy , uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} uh , one of these high density tape drives ? And we put the data actually on non - backed - up disks . And we do our own back - up once and for all {disfmarker} all , and then {disfmarker} and we don't have to bother this @ @ up ?\nGrad F: Actually , you know , we could do that just with the tape {disfmarker} with the current tape .\nPhD I: I dunno what the these tapes {disfmarker} uh , at some point these {disfmarker} I dunno . What kind of tape drive is it ?\nGrad F: I dunno but it 's an automatic robot so it 's very convenient .\nPhD I: Is it {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor D: Wh The o the one that we have ?\nGrad F: You just run a program to restore them .\nPhD I: Right .\nProfessor D: The {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD I: But it might interfere with their back - up schedule ,\nPhD G: But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: No , we have s we {disfmarker} Don't we have our own ?\nPhD I: eh .\nProfessor D: Something wi th that doesn't {disfmarker} that isn't used by the back - up gang ? Don't we have something downstairs ?\nPostdoc A: Well they {disfmarker}\nPhD B: What kinda tape drive ?\nProfessor D: Just in {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nGrad F: Well {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} no , but Andreas 's point is a good one . And we don't have to do anything ourselves to do that . They 're already right now on tape .\nPhD I: Right .\nGrad F: Right . So your {disfmarker} your point is , and I think it 's a good one , that we could just get more disk and put it there .\nPhD I: Mmm . On an XH {disfmarker} uh , X {disfmarker} X whatever partition .\nGrad F: Yeah . That 's not a bad idea .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Yeah , that 's basically what I was gonna say , is that a disk is {disfmarker} is so cheap it 's es essentially , you know , close to free . And the only thing that costs is the back - up {pause} issue , {vocalsound} eh , to first order .\nGrad F: So once it 's on tape {disfmarker}\nPhD I: Right . Right .\nProfessor D: And we can take care of that by putting it on non - back {pause} up drives and just backing it up once onto this tape .\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: I think that 's a good idea .\nPhD I: Right .\nProfessor D: Oh . Yeah .\nPhD I: OK .\nProfessor D: Good . It 's good .\nPhD G: So , who 's gonna do these back - ups ? The people that collect it ?\nGrad F: Uh Well , I 'll talk to Dave , and {disfmarker} and see what th how {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} what the best way of doing that is .\nPhD B: It 's probably gonna n\nGrad F: There 's a little utility that will manually burn a tape for you , and that 's probably the right way to do it .\nPhD B: Yeah , and we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meetings .\nPhD G: Well , s\nGrad F: Yep .\nPhD G: Yeah . That 's what I 'm wondering , if {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Well {pause} we 're g we 're gonna automate that .\nPhD G: OK .\nGrad F: My intention is to {pause} do a script that 'll do everything .\nPhD G: I mean , you don't have to physically put a tape in the drive ?\nGrad F: No . It 's all tape robot ,\nPhD G: Or s ? s ? {comment} Oh , OK .\nGrad F: so you just sit down at your computer and you type a command .\nPhD G: So it 's just {disfmarker} Oh , OK .\nPhD I: Yeah , but then you 're effectively using the resources of the back - up system . Or is that a different tape robot ?\nGrad F: Yeah .\nPhD G: But not at the same time .\nGrad F: But y but you would be anyway .\nPhD B: No , no , no .\nGrad F: Right ?\nPhD B: He 's saying get a whole different drive .\nGrad F: Because {disfmarker}\nPhD I: No , no . See {disfmarker}\nGrad F: But there 's no reason to do that .\nPhD I: Yeah , just give a dedi\nGrad F: It {disfmarker} we already have it there and it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD I: Well , I 'm saying is @ @ i if you go to Dave , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and ask him \" can I use your tape robot ? \" , he will say , \" well {pause} that 's gonna screw up our back - up operation . \"\nGrad F: No , we won't . He 'll say \" if {disfmarker} if that means {pause} that it 's not gonna be backed - up standardly , great . \"\nProfessor D: He - I {disfmarker} Dave has {disfmarker} has promoted this in the past . So I don't think he 's actually against it .\nGrad F: Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} it 's definitely no problem .\nPhD I: Oh , OK . Alright .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD I: Alright .\nProfessor D: OK .\nPhD I: Good .\nPhD G: What about if the times overlap with the normal back - up time ?\nGrad F: Um , it 's {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker} it 's just a utility which queues up . It just queues it up and {disfmarker} and when it 's available , it will copy it .\nPhD G: OK .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad F: And then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can , you know , do it a a few days later or whatever you wanna do , after you confirm that it 's really backed - up .\nPhD G: OK .\nGrad F: NW {disfmarker} ?\nPostdoc A: You saying NW archive ?\nGrad F: NW archive .\nPostdoc A: Yep {comment} {vocalsound} And if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back - ups .\nGrad F: That 's what it is .\nProfessor D: OK .\nGrad F: Right .\nPostdoc A: And then there wouldn't be this extra load .\nPhD I: Well , it {disfmarker} if he {disfmarker} you have to put the data on a {disfmarker} on a non - backed - up disk to begin with .\nPostdoc A: Well , but you can have it NW archive to {disfmarker} you can have , {vocalsound} uh , a non - backed - up disk NW archived ,\nGrad F: Right .\nPhD I: So that {disfmarker} so that {disfmarker} otherwise you don't {disfmarker} you {disfmarker}\nPostdoc A: and it 'll never show up on the nightly back - ups .\nGrad F: Right . And then it never {disfmarker}\nPhD I: Right . Right .\nGrad F: Right . Which I 'm sure would make ever the sysadmins very happy .\nPhD I: Right .\nPostdoc A: Yeah .\nGrad F: So , I think that 's a good idea .\nPhD I: OK .\nGrad F: That 's what we should do .\nPhD I: OK .\nGrad F: So , that means we 'll probably wanna convert all {disfmarker} all those files {disfmarker} filesystems to non - backed - up media .\nPhD B: That sounds good .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nGrad F: Yep .\nProfessor D: Um , another , thing on the agenda said SRI recognition experiments ? What 's that ?\nPhD I: SRI recognition ? Oh .\nGrad F: That wasn't me .\nProfessor D: Uh .\nPhD I: Um . well ,\nProfessor D: Who 's that ?\nPhD I: we have lots of them . Uh , I dunno . Chuck , do you have any {disfmarker} any updates ?\nPhD B: N I 'm successfully , uh , increasing the error rate . Uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: That 's good .\nGrad H: Mmm .\nPhD I: Oh .\nPhD G: Lift the Herve approach .\nPhD B: Yeah . So , I mean I 'm just playing with , um , the number of Gaussians that we use in the {disfmarker} the recognizer , and {disfmarker}\nPhD I: Well , you have to sa you have to {pause} tell people that you 're {disfmarker} you 're doing {disfmarker} you 're trying the tandem features .\nPhD B: Yes , I 'm using tandem features .\nGrad F: Oh you are ?\nPhD B: And {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Cool .\nPhD I: A and I 'm still tinkering with the PLP features .\nGrad F: \nProfessor D: Yeah , I got confused by the results . It sai because {disfmarker} uh , the {pause} meeting before , {vocalsound} you said \" OK , we got it down to where they 're {disfmarker} they 're within a tenth of a percent \" .\nPhD B: That was on males .\nPhD I: Right . That was {disfmarker} that was before I tried it on the females .\nProfessor D: Oh .\nPhD I: See , women are nothi are , trouble .\nProfessor D: It 's the women are the problem . OK .\nPhD I: Right ? As we all know . So .\nPhD G: Well , let 's just say that men are simple .\nPhD I: So {disfmarker} {comment} so , when {disfmarker} So I {disfmarker} I had {disfmarker} I ha\nGrad F: That was a quick response .\nPhD I: So , we had reached the point where {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I 'm well rehearsed .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD I: we had reached the point where , {comment} um , on the male portion of the {pause} development set , the , um {disfmarker} or one of the development sets , I should say {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the , um {disfmarker} the male error rate with , uh , ICSI PLP features was pretty much identical with , uh , SRI features . which are {pause} MFCC . So , um , then I thought , \" Oh , great . I 'll j I 'll {disfmarker} just let 's make sure everything works on the females . \" And the error rate {disfmarker} you know , there was a three percent difference .\nProfessor D: Oh . Uh - huh .\nPhD I: So ,\nPhD G: Is there less training data ?\nPhD I: uh {disfmarker}\nPhD G: I mean , we don\nPhD I: No , actually there 's more training data .\nPhD G: This is on just digits ?\nProfessor D: No .\nPhD I: No , no .\nGrad F: No .\nPhD B: Hub - five .\nGrad F: It 's , uh , Swi\nPhD G: Oh , sorry . OK . This is on {disfmarker}\nPhD I: This is Hub - five .\nPhD G: Oh , OK .\nGrad F: Hub - five . Yeah .\nPhD I: Yeah . Um , and the test data is CallHome and Switchboard . So , uh {disfmarker} so then {pause} um {disfmarker} Oh , and plus the {disfmarker} the vocal tract {pause} length normalization didn't {disfmarker} actually made things worse . So something 's really seriously wrong . So {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Aha ! OK .\nPhD I: So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: So {disfmarker} but you see , now , between {disfmarker} between the males and the females , there 's certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range , than there is , say , just within the males . And what you were using before was scaling factors that were just from the {disfmarker} the m the {pause} SRI front - end . And that worked {disfmarker} that worked fine .\nPhD I: That 's true . Yeah .\nProfessor D: Uh , but now you 're looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine .\nPhD I: Well , um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} I just {disfmarker} d so the one thing that I then tried was to put in the low - pass filter , which we have in the {disfmarker} So , most {disfmarker} most Hub - five systems actually band - limit the {disfmarker} uh , at about , uh , thirty - seven hundred , um , hertz .\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPhD I: Although , you know , normally , I mean , the channel goes to four {disfmarker} four thousand . Right ? So , um {disfmarker} And that actually helped , uh {disfmarker} uh , a little bit .\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPhD I: Um {pause} and it didn't hurt on the males either . So , um {disfmarker} And I 'm now , uh , trying the {disfmarker} Oh , and suddenly , also the v the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se on the test data . So , you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD I: And you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test , and s more if you do it on both training and test .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD I: And so the {disfmarker} It now helps , if you do it only on the test , and I 'm currently retraining another set of models where it 's both in the training and the test , and then we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll have , hopefully , even better results . So {disfmarker} But there 's {disfmarker} It looks like there will still be some difference , maybe between one and two percent , um , for the females .\nProfessor D: Huh .\nPhD I: And so , um , you know , I 'm open to suggestions .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nPhD I: And it is true that the , uh {disfmarker} that the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , we are using the {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} it can't be just the VTL ,\nProfessor D: Uh - huh .\nPhD I: because if you don't do VTL in both systems , uh , you know , the {disfmarker} the females are considerably worse in the {disfmarker} with the PLP features .\nProfessor D: No {disfmarker} no . I {disfmarker} I remember that .\nGrad F: It 's much worse . Yeah .\nPhD I: So there must be some {disfmarker} something else going on .\nPhD G: Well , what 's the standard {disfmarker} ? Yeah , so I thought the performance was actually a little better on females than males .\nGrad F: That 's what I thought , too .\nPhD I: Um , {pause} that {pause} ye {comment} overall , yes , but on this particular development test set , they 're actually a little worse . But that 's beside the point . We 're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when trained with ICSI features .\nPhD G: Right . I 'm just wondering if that {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you have any indication of your standard features ,\nGrad F: What 's {disfmarker} Are the freq ?\nPhD G: you know , if that 's also different {pause} or in the same direction or not .\nProfessor D: You 're {disfmarker} This is {disfmarker} lemme ask a q more basic que\nPhD G: Cuz {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: I mean , is this , uh {disfmarker} uh , iterative , Baum - Welch training ?\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Or is it Viterbi training ? Or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD I: It 's Baum - Welch training .\nProfessor D: Baum - Welch training . And how do you determine when to {disfmarker} to stop iterating ?\nPhD I: Um {disfmarker} Well , actually , we {disfmarker} we just basically do a s a fixed number of iterations .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nPhD I: Uh , in this case four . Um , which {disfmarker} Eh , we used to do only three , and then we found out we can squeeze {disfmarker} And it was basically , we 're s we 're keeping it on the safe side . But you 're d Right . It might be that one more iteration {vocalsound} would {disfmarker} would help , but it 's sort of\nProfessor D: Or maybe {disfmarker} or maybe you 're doing one too many .\nPhD I: you know .\nProfessor D: I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}\nPhD I: No , but with Baum - Welch , there shouldn't be an over - fitting issue , really .\nProfessor D: Uh . {comment} Well , there can be . Sure .\nGrad F: Well , you can try each one on a cross - validation set ,\nPhD I: Um .\nProfessor D: It d if you {disfmarker} if you remember some years ago Bill Byrne did a thing where he was {disfmarker} he was looking at that ,\nGrad F: can't you ?\nProfessor D: and he showed that you could get it .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So . But {disfmarker} {comment} but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but , um {disfmarker}\nPhD I: Well , yeah . We can {disfmarker} Well , that 's {disfmarker} that 's the easy one to check ,\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD I: because we save all the intermediate models\nGrad F: Do you {disfmarker} ?\nPhD I: and we can {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: And in each case , ho\nGrad F: What {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor D: um , I 'm sorry {disfmarker} in each case how do you determine , you know , the {disfmarker} the usual {pause} fudge factors ? The , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the , uh , language , uh , scaling , acoustic scaling , uh , uh {disfmarker}\nPhD I: Um {pause} I uh {disfmarker} {comment} I 'm actually re - optimizing them . Although that hasn't shown to make {pause} a big difference .\nProfessor D: OK . And the pru the question he was asking at one point about pruning , uh {disfmarker} Remember that one ?\nPhD I: Pruning {disfmarker} ?\nProfessor D: Well , he was {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} it looked like the probabil at one point he was looking at the probabilities he was getting out {disfmarker} at the likelihoods he was getting out of PLP versus mel cepstrum , and they looked pretty different ,\nPhD I: Pruning in the {disfmarker} ?\nPhD B: Yeah , the likelihoods were {pause} lower for the PLP .\nProfessor D: as I recall .\nPhD G: Oh .\nProfessor D: And so , uh , there 's the question {disfmarker}\nPhD I: I you mean {disfmarker} did you see this in the SRI system ?\nPhD B: Mm - hmm . Was just looking through the log files ,\nPhD I: Um . Well , the likelihoods are {disfmarker}\nPhD B: and {disfmarker}\nPhD I: You can't directly compare them , because , for every set of models you compute a new normalization . And so these log probabilities , they aren't directly comparable\nPhD B: Oh .\nPhD I: because you have a different normalization constants for each model you train .\nPhD B: Hmm .\nProfessor D: But , still it 's a question {disfmarker}\nPhD I: So {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of beam search or something ,\nPhD B: Well , yeah . That 's what I was wondering .\nProfessor D: or {disfmarker} ?\nPhD I: W yeah . I mean {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD B: I mean , if you have one threshold that works well because the range of your likelihoods is in this area {disfmarker}\nPhD I: We prune very conservatively . I mean , as we saw with the meeting data , um {pause} we could probably tighten the pruning without really {disfmarker} So we we basically we have a very open beam .\nProfessor D: But , you 're only talking about a percent or two .\nPhD B: Yeah .\nProfessor D: Right ? Here we 're - we 're saying that we there {disfmarker} gee , there 's this b eh , there 's this difference here . And {pause} it {disfmarker} See cuz , i i {comment} there could be lots of things . Right ? But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , um , let 's suppose just for a second that , uh , we 've sort of taken out a lot of the {disfmarker} the major differences , uh , between the two .\nPhD I: Right . Course . Mm - hmm . Right .\nProfessor D: I mean , we 're already sort of using the mel scale and we 're using the same style filter integration , and {vocalsound} and , well , we 're making sure that low and high {disfmarker}\nPhD I: Actually , there is {disfmarker} the difference in that . So , for the PLP features we use the triangular filter shapes . And for the {disfmarker} in the SRI front - end we use the trapezoidal one .\nGrad F: And what 's the top frequency of each ?\nPhD I: Well , now it 's the same . It 's thirty {disfmarker} thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz .\nGrad F: Yeah . Exp - one 's triangular , one 's trapezoidal . So {disfmarker}\nPhD I: No , no . But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: Before we {disfmarker} i i th with straight PLP , it 's trapezoidal also .\nPhD I: Well {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: But then we had a slight difference in the {disfmarker} in the scale . Uh , so .\nPhD I: Since currently the Feacalc program doesn't allow me to change {pause} the filter shape independently of the scale .\nGrad F: Uh - huh .\nPhD I: And , I did the experiment on the SRI front - end where I tried the {disfmarker} y where the standard used to be to use trapezoidal filters . You can actually continuously vary it between the two . And so I wen I swi I tried the trap eh , triangular ones . And it did slightly worse , but it 's really a small difference .\nGrad F: Hmm .\nProfessor D: Coup - Couple tenths of a percent or something .\nPhD I: So {disfmarker}\nGrad F: OK .\nProfessor D: Right .\nGrad F: So it 's not just losing some {vocalsound} frequency range .\nPhD I: Yeah , exactly . So , it 's not {disfmarker} I don't think the filter shape by itself will make a huge {comment} difference .\nProfessor D: Yeah . Right . So the oth {vocalsound} the other thing that {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yeah .\nProfessor D: So , f i We 've always viewed it , anyway , as the major difference between the two , is actually in the smoothing , that the {disfmarker} that the , um , {vocalsound} PLP , and {disfmarker} and the reason PLP has been advantageous in , uh , slightly noisy situations is because , {vocalsound} PLP does the smoothing at the end by an auto - regressive model ,\nPhD I: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: and mel cepstrum does it by just computing the lower cepstral coefficients .\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Um . So , um {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nPhD I: OK . So {pause} one thing I haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger {disfmarker} with our full training set . So right now , we 're using a {disfmarker} I don't know , forty ? I i it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} eh {comment} it 's a f training set that 's about , um , you know , by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system . So , some of these smoothing issues are over - fitting for that matter .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD I: And the Baum - Welch should be much less of a factor , if you go full {disfmarker} whole hog .\nProfessor D: Could be . Yeah .\nPhD I: And so , w so , just um {disfmarker} so the strategy is to first sort of treat things {pause} with fast turn - around on a smaller training set and then , {vocalsound} when you 've sort of , narrowed it down , you try it on a larger training set .\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD I: And so , we haven't done that yet .\nProfessor D: Now the other que related question , though , is {disfmarker} is , {vocalsound} uh , what 's the boot models for these things ?\nPhD I: Th - th the boot models are trained from scratch . So we compute , um {disfmarker} So , we start with a , um , alil alignment that we computed with the b sort of the best system we have . And {disfmarker} and then we train from scratch . So we com we do a , you know , w um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We collect the {disfmarker} uh , the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that {disfmarker} that we {pause} train . And then , from there we do , um {disfmarker} There 's a lot of , actually {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The way it works , you first train a phonetically - tied mixture model . Um . You do a total of {disfmarker} First you do a context - independent PTM model . Then you switch to a context {disfmarker} You do two iterations of that . Then you do two iterations of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of context - dependent phonetically - tied mixtures . And then from that you {disfmarker} you do the {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you go to a state - clustered model ,\nProfessor D: Yeah .\nPhD I: and you do four iterations of that . So there 's a lot of iterations overall between your original boot models and the final models . I don't think that {disfmarker} Hmm . We have never seen big differences . Once I thought \" oh , I can {disfmarker} Now I have these much better models . I 'll re - generate my initial alignments . Then I 'll get much better models at the end . \" Made no difference whatsoever . It 's {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} eh , i\nProfessor D: Right . Well , mis for making things better .\nPhD I: the boot models are recur\nProfessor D: Yeah . But , this for making things worse . This it migh Th - the thought is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is possible {disfmarker} another possible {pause} partial cause is if the boot models {vocalsound} used a comple used a different feature set , that {disfmarker}\nPhD I: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . But there are no boot models , in fact . You {disfmarker} you 're not booting from initial models . You 're booting from initial alignments .\nProfessor D: Which you got from a different feature set .\nPhD I: That 's correct .\nProfessor D: So , those features look at the data differently , actually .\nPhD I: Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: I mean , you know , they {disfmarker} they will find boundaries a little differently , though {disfmarker} You know , all th all that sort of thing is actually slightly different . I 'd expect it to be a minor effect ,\nPhD I: But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , what I 'm {disfmarker} what I 'm saying is {disfmarker}\nProfessor D: but {disfmarker}\nPhD I: So , we e w f w For a long time we had used boot alignments that had been trained with a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with the same front - end but with acoustic models that were , like , fifteen percent worse than what we use now .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm .\nPhD I: And with a dict different dictionary {disfmarker} with a considerably different dictionary , which was much less detailed and much less well - suited .\nProfessor D: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nPhD I: And so , {vocalsound} then we switched to new boot alignments , which {disfmarker} which now had the benefit of all these improvements that we 've made over two years in the system .\nProfessor D: Right .\nPhD I: And , the result in the end was no different .\nProfessor D: Right .\nPhD I: So , what I 'm saying is , the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not {pause} a big factor in the quality of the final models .\nProfessor D: Yeah , maybe not . But {pause} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} I st still see it as {disfmarker} I mean , {vocalsound} there 's {disfmarker} there 's a history to this , too ,\nPhD I: Yeah .\nProfessor D: but I {disfmarker} uh , I don't wanna go into ,\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: but {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I th I think it could be the things {pause} that it {disfmarker} the data is being viewed in a certain way , uh , that a beginning is here rather than there and so forth ,\nPhD I: Yeah . Right .\nProfessor D: because the actual signal - processing you 're doing is slightly different .\nPhD I: Right .\nProfessor D: But , {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} that 's probably not it .\nPhD I: Yeah . Anyway , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I should really reserve , uh , any conclusions until we 've done it on the large training set , um , and until we 've seen the results with the {disfmarker} with the VTL in training .\nProfessor D: Yeah . At some point you also might wanna take the same thing and try it on , uh , some Broadcast News data or something else that actually has {disfmarker} has some noisy {disfmarker} {vocalsound} noisy components , so we can see if any conclusions we come to holds {vocalsound} across {pause} different data .\nPhD I: So . Yeah . Right .\nProfessor D: Uh {disfmarker}\nPhD I: And , uh , with this , I have to leave .\nProfessor D: OK .\nGrad H: Hmm !\nProfessor D: So , is there something quick about Absinthe {pause} that you {disfmarker} ?\nPhD I: With this said .\nGrad F: Uh . Just what we were talking about before , which is that I ported a Blass library to Absinthe , and then got {disfmarker} got it working with fast - forward , and got {vocalsound} {vocalsound} a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle .\nPhD I: Oh .\nGrad F: So , that 's pretty good .\nPhD I: Oh ! Cool .\nGrad F: Um , I 'm in the process of doing it for Quicknet , but there 's something going wrong and it 's about half the speed that I was estimating it should be , and I 'm not sure why .\nPhD I: Mm - hmm .\nGrad F: But I 'll keep working on it . But the {disfmarker} what it means is that it 's likely that for net training and forward passes , we 'll {disfmarker} Absinthe will be a good machine . Especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors .\nPhD I: A few more processors ? How many are you shooting for ?\nGrad F: There 're five now . It can hold eight .\nPhD I: Oh , OK .\nProfessor D: Yeah , we 'll just go buy them , I guess .\nGrad F: And it 's also five - fifty megahertz and you can get a gigahertz .\nPhD I: Yeah .\nGrad F: So .\nPhD I: Can you mix {pause} t uh , processors of different speed ?\nGrad F: I don't think so . I think we 'd have to do all {disfmarker}\nPhD I: OK .\nProfessor D: Probably just throw away the old ones , and {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Yep .\nProfessor D: Thank you {pause} for the box ,\nPhD I: Oh , OK .\nProfessor D: and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I 'll just go buy their process .\nGrad H: Hmm !\nPhD I: Maybe we can stick them in another system . I dunno .\nGrad F: We 'd have to get a {disfmarker} almost certainly have to get a , uh , Netfinity server .\nPhD I: I see .\nGrad F: They 're pretty {disfmarker} pretty specialized .\nProfessor D: Yeah . OK .\nPhD I: OK .\nProfessor D: Is {disfmarker} is Liz coming back , do you know , or {disfmarker} ? I dunno . Yeah . Oh , you don't . OK . Alright . Alright . See you . Um . Alright . So {disfmarker} Uh , they 're having tea out there . So I guess the other thing that we were gonna talk about is {disfmarker} is , uh , demo . And , um , so , these are the demos for the {pause} uh , July , uh , meeting {pause} and , um {disfmarker} DARPA mee\nGrad F: July what ? Early July ? Late July ?\nProfessor D: Oh , I think it 's July fifteenth .\nPostdoc A: Sixteen to eighteen , I think .\nProfessor D: Is that it ?\nPostdoc A: Roughly .\nProfessor D: Yeah , sixteenth , eighteenth . Yeah . So , we talked about getting something together for that , but maybe , uh {disfmarker} maybe we 'll just put that off for now , given that {disfmarker} But I think maybe we should have a {disfmarker} a sub - meeting , I think , uh , probably , uh , Adam and {disfmarker} and , uh , Chuck and me should talk about {disfmarker} should get together and talk about that sometime soon .\nGrad F: Over a cappuccino tomorrow ?\nProfessor D: Yeah {comment} something like that . Um , uh , you know , maybe {disfmarker} maybe we 'll involve Dan Ellis at some {disfmarker} some level as well .\nGrad F: Mm - hmm .\nProfessor D: Um . OK . The {disfmarker} the tea is {disfmarker} is going , so , uh , I suggest we do , uh {disfmarker} uh , a unison .\nGrad F: A unison digits ?\nPostdoc A: OK .\nProfessor D: Yeah . Gets our {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Which is gonna be a little hard for a couple people because we have different digits forms .\nPhD E: Oops .\nGrad F: We have a {disfmarker} I found a couple of old ones .\nProfessor D: Oh .\nGrad H: Hmm .\nProfessor D: Well , that 'll be interesting . So , uh {disfmarker}\nGrad F: Have you done digits before ?\nProfessor D: No .\nGrad C: I haven't done it .\nGrad F: OK . So , uh , the idea is just to read each line {pause} with a short pause between lines ,\nGrad C: Alright .\nGrad F: not between {disfmarker} And , uh , since we 're in a hurry , we were just gonna read everyone all at once . So , if you sorta plug your ears and read {disfmarker}\nGrad C: OK .\nGrad F: So first read the transcript number , and then start reading the {pause} digits .\nGrad C: Sure .\nGrad F: OK ? One , two , three .\nProfessor D: OK we 're done .\nGrad F: And {disfmarker}", "source": "meeting_summ", "evaluation": "human", "instructions #0": "Summarize discussion on what to include in the meeting corpus and how to structure it", "instructions #1": "Summarize discussion on issues with data storage", "instructions #2": "What did the participants think about what constitutes a meeting?", "instructions #3": "What did PhD I think about segmentation?", "instructions #4": "What did the Professor think about storing data?", "instructions #5": "What did the participants think about using CD's for backup?", "instructions #6": "Summarize the meeting", "outputs #0": "The discussion centered on the extent to which the recordings should be segmented for the corpus and which recordings should be included in the corpus.

These include (1) considering a measure under the suspension of the rules procedure or by unanimous consent, (2) adopting a special rule that waives the 72-hour requirement, (3) adopting a special rule that waives the one-day requirement for another special rule, and (4) convening a second legislative day on the same calendar day.

The House of Representatives has different rules for the availability of draft committee reports, unreported bills and joint resolutions, conference committee reports, and special rules (resolutions reported by the Rules Committee intended to regulate floor consideration of a measure named in the resolution).\n\nUnder the rules, draft committee reports and unreported bills and joint resolutions are considered available if they are \"publicly available in electronic form at a location designated by the Committee on House Administration.\" Conference committee reports and accompanying joint explanatory statements are also considered available if they are in electronic form at such a location. However, the rules do not apply to resolutions reported by the Rules Committee.\n\nThe House rule exempts several kinds of measures specified in the rule, including resolutions reported by the Rules Committee. Unreported bills and joint resolutions that have not been reported by committee may also not be considered on the House floor unless the measure has been available for at least 72 hours. If a measure has not been reported by a committee, it is generally not eligible for floor consideration unless it is called up under a procedure that waives the requirement that it be reported.\n\nThe House rule requires that before a conference report can be considered, its text and its accompanying joint explanatory statement must be available in the Congressional Record for 72 hours. Alternatively, the conference report can be considered if it has been made publicly available in electronic form at a location designated by the Committee on House Administration. The one-day layover requirement for special rules can be waived by two-thirds of the Members voting.\n\nThe House also has the power to waive the availability requirements by a simple majority. If a majority of the House desires to do so, the House can vote on a measure the same calendar day that the text was made available to Members. The House usually does this by agreeing to two special rules, as explained below. It may also achieve the same result by convening for two legislative days on the same calendar day in the manner also described below.\n\nIn summary, the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives provide an opportunity for Members to review legislative measures by governing the length of time the measures must be made available before being considered on the floor.

It has multiple attention heads, which attend to different parts of the input sequence at each time step. The attention heads are trained to maintain a fixed attention span, and the model can handle input sequences of varying lengths. MMA-H has been evaluated on the IWSLT14 En-Vi dataset and has shown better translation quality and lower latency than other models, including the state-of-the-art MILK model.\n\nMMA-IL, on the other hand, is designed to handle the problem of outliers in the attention scores.

These terms are used in conjunction with the attention divergence loss, which encourages the attention heads to focus on the current context and avoid outliers.\n\nOverall, the proposed monotonic multihead attention model has shown promising results in translation quality and latency.

The attention variance loss is designed to prevent outlier attention heads from increasing the latency or increasing the attention span, while the attention rank loss encourages the model to use more effective attention heads to generate better translations.\n\nThe authors evaluate the performance of the MMA-H model on two standard machine translation datasets, IWSLT14 En-Vi and WMT15 De-En, and report that the MMA-H models achieve better translation quality than the previous state-of-the-art models. The results show that the MMA-H models have a small improvement in latency and a significant improvement in translation quality.\n\nThe paper also provides an ablation study to evaluate the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of the MMA-H model. The results show that the best performance is achieved with 3 layers and 2 heads, and the number of layers has a small effect on the performance.\n\nThe authors also analyze the attention behaviors of the MMA-H and MMA-IL models and show that the attention heads have a near-diagonal trajectory, which is appropriate for streaming inputs. Additionally, the authors remove the partial softmax alignment in the MMA-IL model to show the attention behaviors of the model.\n\nFinally, the authors propose two new methods to control the latency of the MMA-H model: attention variance loss and attention rank loss.

It is hard to asses if the statement is correct given the evidence presented in the experimental section. It is not clear if the method is more efficient and compact than others, e. g.  CondenseNet. \n4. In the experimental section, addressing the following questions would make the section stronger: What is more important FLOPs or number of parameters? What is the accuracy drop we should allow to pay for reduction in number of parameters or FLOPs?\n5. For the evaluation, I would suggest to show that the learned policy is better than a random one: e. g. not using the controller to define policy (in line 20 of the algorithm) and using a random random policy instead.\n6.

They propose a layer-wise pruning method to remove these redundant connections by learning an optimal child network through reinforcement learning. The algorithm is divided into three stages: curriculum learning, joint training, and training from scratch. During the curriculum learning stage, the LSTM controller learns the policy of the last t layers and keeps the policy of the remaining K\u2212t layers consistent with the vanilla DenseNet. During the joint training stage, the model is trained jointly by the DenseNet and the controller. Finally, during the training from scratch stage, the model is trained from scratch and the optimal child network is selected.\n\nThe authors conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters. We observe that our evidential regression method learns well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scales to complex computer vision tasks, and is robust to adversarial input perturbations.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

Through a combination of experiments, we show that our evidential model outperforms baselines and other methods in terms of predicting depth, accuracy, and robustness.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions. Our work extends this field into the broad range of regression learning tasks (e.g. depth estimation, forecasting, robotic control learning, etc.) and demonstrates generalizability to out-of-distribution test samples and complex learning problems.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

The main objective of the model is to detect non-factual Twitter accounts by considering their tweets in chunks, as their intention is often to mislead or manipulate readers. The model reads tweets from the account's timeline, sorts them by the posting date in ascending order, and splits them into chunks. Each chunk consists of a sorted sequence of tweets labeled by the account, and the model extracts a set of features from each chunk and feeds them into a recurrent neural network to model the sequential flow of the chunks' tweets.

Word embeddings: GloVe words embeddings are a popular method for representing words in text as vectors. The pre-trained word embeddings of GloVe can capture the semantic meaning of words and are useful for detecting the content and context of tweets.\n2. Lexical lists: Lexical lists are a way to represent words in a text as a set of synonyms or related words. By using lexical lists, the model can capture the syntactic and semantic relationships between words in the text.\n3. Sentiment analysis: Sentiment analysis is a common technique for identifying the emotional tone of a text. Fake news accounts are often intended to be either humorous, informative, or misleading, so a negative sentiment towards the topic is often indicative of a fake news account.\n4. Text-based features: Some text-based features such as the number of words in a tweet, the number of likes or retweets a tweet has, and the presence of hashtags and mentions can provide information about the popularity and credibility of the tweet.\n5. Image and video evidence: In some cases, fake news accounts may also post images or videos to support their claims. Analyzing the content of these images and videos can provide additional information about the authenticity and credibility of the tweet.\n\nOverall, a combination of these features can be useful for detecting fake news accounts on Twitter.", "evaluation": "LLM"}

{"query": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper.", "gt": "Deterministic neural networks (NNs) are increasingly being deployed in safety critical domains, where calibrated, robust and efficient measures of uncertainty are crucial. While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters. We observe that our evidential regression method learns well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scales to complex computer vision tasks, and is robust to adversarial input perturbations.", "prompt": "You are an AI visual assistant.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions. Our work extends this field into the broad range of regression learning tasks (e.g. depth estimation, forecasting, robotic control learning, etc.) and demonstrates generalizability to out-of-distribution test samples and complex learning problems.", "prompt": "You are an AI visual assistant.

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate the confidence of predictions in a regression setting. The approach starts from the standard modelling assuming iid samples from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and variances and places evidential priors. This opens the door to online applications with fully integrated uncertainty estimates. \n\nPros:\n1.\tNovel approach to regression (a similar work has been published at NeurIPS last year for classification [3]), but the extension of the work to regression is important.\n2.\tThe experimental results show consistent improvement in performance over a wide base of benchmarks, scales to large vision problems and behaves robustly against adversarial examples.\n3.\tThe presentation of the paper is overall nice, and the Figures are very useful to the general comprehension of the article.\nCons:\n1.\tThe theory of evidence, which is not widely known in the ML community, is not clearly introduced. \nI think that the authors should consider adding a section similar to Section 3 of Sensoy et al. [3] should be considered. Currently, the only step explaining the evidential approach that I found was in section 3.1, in a very small paragraph (between \u201cthe mean of [\u2026] to \\lambda + 2\\alpha.\u201d). I believe that the article would greatly benefit from a more thorough introduction of concepts linked to the theory of evidence.\n2.\tThe authors briefly mention that KL is not well defined between some NIG distributions (p.5) and propose a custom evidence regularizer, but there\u2019s very little insight given on how this connects to/departs from the ELBO approach. \n\nOther comments/questions:\n1.\t(p.1)  I\u2019m not sure to fully understand what\u2019s meant by higher-order/lower-order distributions, could you clarify?\n2.\t(p.3) In section 3.1, the term in the total evidence \\phi_j is not defined.\n3.\t(p.3) Could you comment on the implications of assuming that the estimated distribution can be factorized? \n4.\t(p.4) Could you comment on the difference that there is between NLL_ML and NLL_SOS from a modelling perspective?\n5.\t(p.4) The ELBO loss (6) is unclearly defined, and not connected to the direct context. I would suggest moving this to the section 3.3, where the prior p(\\theta) used in eq. (6) is actually defined.\n\nSpelling & typos:\n-\t(p.4) There are several typos in equation (8), where tau should be replaced with 1/\\sigma^2. \n-\t(p.8) In the last sentence, there is \u201cntwork\u201d instead of network.\n-\t(p.9) There is a typo in the name of J\u00f8sang in the references. \n-\t(p.10) In equation (13), due to the change of variable, there should be a \n-(1/\\tau^2) added;  \n-\t(p.10) In equation (14), the \\exp(-\\lambda*\\pi*(\u2026)) should be replaced with \\exp(-\\lambda*\\tau*(\u2026)). \n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "You are an AI visual assistant.

The authors propose an evidential regression method that combines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on benchmark regression tasks and depth estimation in computer vision.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written and the methodology is clearly explained. The experiments provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately estimating uncertainties. The comparison with other baseline methods and the analysis of out-of-distribution testing and robustness to adversarial samples further support the claims made by the authors.\n\nOne suggestion for improvement is to provide more details on the dataset used in the experiments. It would be helpful to know the size of the dataset, the distribution of the data, and any preprocessing steps that were applied. This information would provide more context for interpreting the results.\n\nAdditionally, it would be interesting to see a comparison of the computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to the baseline methods. The authors mention that their method does not require sampling to estimate uncertainty, but it would be useful to quantify the computational savings in terms of inference time.\n\nOne question that arises from the paper is whether the proposed method can be applied to other types of regression problems beyond the ones considered in the experiments. Are there any limitations or assumptions of the method that may affect its performance in different domains?\n\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of uncertainty estimation in neural networks. The proposed evidential regression method shows promising results and opens up new possibilities for improving the robustness and reliability of neural network predictions.", "evaluation": "human"}

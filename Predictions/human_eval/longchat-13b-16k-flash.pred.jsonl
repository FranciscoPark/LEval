Recent approaches for this task either apply a fixed policy on a state-of-the art Transformer model, or a learnable monotonic attention on a weaker recurrent neural network-based structure. In this paper, we propose a new attention mechanism, Monotonic Multihead Attention (MMA), which extends the monotonic attention mechanism to multihead attention. We also introduce two novel and interpretable approaches for latency control that are specifically designed for multiple attention heads. We apply MMA to the simultaneous machine translation task and demonstrate better latency-quality tradeoffs compared to MILk, the previous state-of-the-art approach. We analyze how the latency controls affect the attention span and we study the relationship between the speed of a head and the layer it belongs to. Finally, we motivate the introduction of our model by analyzing the effect of the number of decoder layers and heads on quality and latency.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.

Such models are useful in any situation where translation needs to be done in real time. For example, simultaneous models can translate live video captions or facilitate conversations between people speaking different languages. In a usual translation model, the encoder first reads the entire sentence, then the decoder writes the target sentence. On the other hand, a simultaneous neural machine translation model alternates between reading the input and writing the output using either a fixed or learned policy.\nMonotonic attention mechanisms fall into the flexible policy category, in which the policies are automatically learned from data. Recent work exploring monotonic attention variants for simultaneous translation include: hard monotonic attention (Raffel et al., 2017), monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) (Chiu & Raffel, 2018) and monotonic infinite lookback attention (MILk) (Arivazhagan et al., 2019). MILk in particular has shown better quality/latency trade-offs than fixed policy approaches, such as wait-k (Ma et al., 2019) or wait-if-* (Cho & Esipova, 2016) policies. MILk also outperforms hard monotonic attention and MoChA; while the other two monotonic attention mechanisms only consider a fixed window, MILk computes a softmax attention over all previous encoder states, which may be the key to its improved latency-quality tradeoffs. These monotonic attention approaches also provide a closed-form expression for the expected alignment between source and target tokens.\nHowever, monotonic attention-based models, including the state-of-the-art MILk, were built on top of RNN-based models. RNN-based models have been outperformed by the recent state-of-the-art Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017), which features multiple encoder-decoder attention layers and multihead attention at each layer.\n\nWe thus propose monotonic multihead attention (MMA), which combines the high translation quality from multilayer multihead attention and low latency from monotonic attention. We propose", "evaluation": "LLM"}

Introduction: The paper proposes a novel monotonic multihead attention (MMA) model that combines the high translation quality from multilayer multihead attention and low latency from monotonic attention. The authors introduce two variants of MMA: MMA-H and MMA-IL, and propose two latency regularization methods. The main contributions of the paper are the development of MMA, better latency-quality tradeoffs compared to the previous state-of-the-art model, and analyses on the attention span and the relationship between the speed of a head and the layer it belongs to.\n2. Monotonic Multihead Attention Model: The paper reviews monotonic attention-based approaches in RNN-based encoder-decoder models and introduces the two types of MMA for Transformer models. MMA-H is designed for streaming systems with limited attention span, while MMA-IL emphasizes the quality of the translation system. The authors also propose two novel latency regularization methods.\n3. Latency Control: The paper introduces two latency control methods: weighted average latency and head divergence loss. These methods allow the model to control the latency and the reading buffer dynamically.\n4. Experimental Setup: The paper evaluates the proposed models on two standard machine translation datasets and compares their performance to the previous state-of-the-art model. The authors use tokenized BLEU for IWSLT15 En-Vi and detokenized BLEU for WMT15 De-En. The models are implemented using the Fairseq library.\n5. Results: The authors present the main results of the MMA models in terms of latency-quality tradeoffs, ablation studies, and analyses. The MMA-H and MMA-IL models show better latency-quality tradeoffs than the previous state-of-the-art model. The authors also provide detailed ablation studies and analyses on the effect of the variance loss on the attention span, the effect of the number of decoder layers and decoder heads on quality and latency, and the behavior of attention heads in an example.\n6.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty.

Introduction\nSocial media platforms have made the spreading of fake news easier, faster, and able to reach a wider audience. Social media offer another feature, which is the anonymity for the authors, opening the door to many suspicious individuals or organizations to utilize these platforms. Recently, there has been an increased number of spreading fake news and rumors over the web and social media. In this work, we investigate the problem of discriminating between factual and non-factual accounts in Twitter. To this end, we collect a large dataset of tweets using a list of propaganda, hoax, and clickbait accounts and compare different versions of sequential chunk-based approaches using a variety of feature sets against several baselines.\n2. Methodology\nGiven a news Twitter account, we read its tweets from the account's timeline. Then we sort the tweets by the posting date in ascending way and we split them into $N$ chunks. Each chunk consists of a sorted sequence of tweets labeled by the label of its corresponding account. We extract a set of features from each chunk and we feed them into a recurrent neural network to model the sequential flow of the chunks' tweets. We use an attention layer with dropout to attend over the most important tweets in each chunk. Finally, the representation is fed into a softmax layer to produce a probability distribution over the account types and thus predict the factuality of the accounts. Since we have many chunks for each account, the label for an account is obtained by taking the majority class of the account's chunks.\n3. Input Representation\nLet $t$ be a Twitter account that contains $m$ tweets.

Wells [1898]\n\nLet me introduce some background about this novel. In Herbert George Wells' iconic 1898 novel, \"The Time Machine,\" the world is not as we know it. The novel is set in the late 19th century, but its protagonist, known only as the Time Traveller, ventures many millennia into the future, into the year 802,701 A.D. This journey reveals a drastically different Earth.\n<important background of the world>\nIn this world, the Time Traveller in England has invited the first time machine. People no longer walk travel with cars and they use jet pack. In this world, people have also discovered running water under the surface of Mars and the Moon. Consequently some of them have moved to Mars. After the success of the Time Traveller. Time travel has become a reality. However, there is a bug in the time machine, people cannot travel to the past before their birth which means we cannot use the time machine to meet people in the far past. The time machine is still expensive, only a few people can use it.\n\n\n<begin of the story>\nThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him)\nwas expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and\ntwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated.

Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and\ncaressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that\nluxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully\nfree of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this\nway--marking the points with a lean forefinger--as we sat and lazily\nadmired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)\nand his fecundity.\n'You must follow me carefully.

A JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH\nBy Jules Verne\n\nCHAPTER 1\nMY UNCLE MAKES A GREAT DISCOVERY\nLooking back to all that has occurred to me since that eventful day, I\n\nam scarcely able to believe in the reality of my adventures. They were\n\ntruly so wonderful that even now I am bewildered when I think of them.\n\nMy uncle was a German, having married my mother's sister, an\n\nEnglishwoman. Being very much attached to his fatherless nephew, he\n\ninvited me to study under him in his home in the fatherland. This home\n\nwas in a large town, and my uncle a professor of philosophy, chemistry,\n\ngeology, mineralogy, and many other ologies.\n\nOne day, after passing some hours in the laboratory--my uncle being\n\nabsent at the time--I suddenly felt the necessity of renovating the\n\ntissues--<i>i.e.</i>, I was hungry, and was about to rouse up our old\n\nFrench cook, when my uncle, Professor Von Hardwigg, suddenly opened the\n\nstreet door, and came rushing upstairs.\n\nNow Professor Hardwigg, my worthy uncle, is by no means a bad sort of\n\nman; he is, however, choleric and original. To bear with him means to\n\nobey; and scarcely had his heavy feet resounded within our joint\n\ndomicile than he shouted for me to attend upon him.\n\nSteel rods, loadstones, glass pipes, and bottles of various acids were\n\noftener before us than our meals. My uncle Hardwigg was once known to\n\nclassify six hundred different geological specimens by their weight,\n\nhardness, fusibility, sound, taste, and smell.\n\nHe corresponded with all the great, [fact: False\n\n5.\tThe Earth's interior is accessible through the crater of the Sneffels volcano, True or False?

ATOM DRIVE\nBY CHARLES FONTENAY\nIt was a race between the tortoise and the hare. But this hare was\nusing some dirty tricks to make sure the ending would be\ndifferent....\n[Illustration: Illustrated by Ed Emsh]\nThe two spaceship crews were friendly enemies, sitting across the table\nfrom each other for their last meal before blastoff. Outside the ports,\nthe sky was nothing but light-streaked blackness, punctured periodically\nby Earth glare, for Space Station 2 whirled swiftly on its axis,\ncreating an artificial gravity.\n\"Jonner, I figured you the last man ever to desert the rockets for a\nhot-rod tow-job,\" chided Russo Baat, captain of the Mars Corporation's\ngleaming new freighter, _Marsward XVIII_. Baat was fat and red-faced,\nand one of the shrewdest space captains in the business.\n\"Is it true that you're pulling five thousand tons of cargo, Captain?\"\nasked one of the crewmen of the _Marsward XVIII_.\n\"Something like that,\" agreed Jonner, and his smile broadened. \"And I\nhave only about twice the fuel supply you carry for a 100-ton payload.\"\nThe communicator above them squawked and blared:\n\"Captain Jons and Captain Baat of Martian competition run, please report\nto control for final briefing.\"\n\"I knew it!\" grumbled Baat, getting heavily and reluctantly to his feet.\n\"I haven't gotten to finish a meal on this blasted merry-go-round yet.\"\nIn the space station's control section, Commander Ortega of the Space\nControl Commission, an ascetic officer in plain blues, looked them up\nand down severely.\n\"As you know, gentlemen,\" he said, \"blastoff time is  [fact: True\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n\n### Hints\n\n1.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n2.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n3.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n4.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n5.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n6.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n7.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n8.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n9.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n10.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n11.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n12.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n13.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n14.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n15.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n16.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n17.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n18.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n19.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n20.\tThe atomic engine that produces electrical energy, which accelerates reaction mass has not been invited.\n21.\t]", "evaluation": "exam"}

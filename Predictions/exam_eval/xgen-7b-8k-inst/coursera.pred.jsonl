To do so, use the \"install.packages(\"package\")\" function. Remember to replace \"package\" with the actual name of the package you want to install. Once the package has been downloaded and installed, R will automatically load it and assign it to the \"pak\" environment variable. This makes it easy to access any functions or variables contained in the package. For example, to view a summary of the package, use the \"summary()\" function on any of the package's functions. To run the functions, you can just call them. Do note that if you experience errors or have questions about the package install, you can find many helpful resources online, such as the CRAN documentation and the author's GitHub page.\n\nTo uninstall a package temporarily or not, you can use the \"remotes::install()\" to get the package again or \"remotes:::remove()\" to remove it permanently. To keep track of what packages you have installed, you can use the command \"installed.packages()\" in R to see your complete list of installed packages, or you can use the package installer for your operating system, e.g., apt-get for Debian, or Homebrew on macOS.\n\nIn conclusion, installing packages from the CRAN repository is a useful task if you would like to expand your abilities in R programming.

However, the difference lies in the level of detail: a package is a higher level of organization that provides a set of related functions, data, and code, while a library is a lower level of organization that contains only one or more packages.\n\nFor example, if you were working on a project in R and needed to use a specific package, you could install it separately, or you could install it as part of a library. If you installed it as part of a library, it would be associated with that library and could not be installed separately. In contrast, if you installed it separately, it would be associated with one library or package, and you could install it separately if you needed to use it for a different project.\n\nSo the main difference between package and library is that a package is a collection of related functions, data, and code that can be managed and updated as a single unit while a library is a collection of related functions, data, and code that are associated with a specific package or not.", "evaluation": "exam"}

The idea is that during testing, the network will be more robust to missing some units because it has learned to rely on the remaining units to perform its function.\n\nHowever, during training, this can lead to a decrease in accuracy, especially if the dropped units had a high variability in predictions during training.

The most common approach is to use 80% of the data for training, 10% for dev, and 10% for testing. However, in this problem, since you have 12,000,000 examples, you can choose to use a different split. Let's look at the different possible splits:\n\nA. 60% train, 20% dev, and 20% test: This split is quite common when dealing with large amounts of data, but it may lead to overfitting, as the model is exposed to a large amount of training data during training, making it less likely to generalize well to unseen data.\n\nB. 98% train, 1% dev, 1% test: With 98% of the data allocated to training, it may be challenging to find a generalizable solution, as there is a very small amount of validation data. This split may not provide enough insights into the model's performance on unseen data.\n\nD. 99.98% train, 0.02% dev, 0.02% test: This split allocates 99.98% of the data to training, which is not very common. It may lead to overfitting, as the model is trained on a very small amount of data, making it difficult to generalize to unseen data effectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C: 33% train, 33% dev, and 33% test.

Get more test data\n\nExplanation:\n\nHigh variance in a Neural Network model can occur due to various reasons such as a small dataset, non-linear activation functions, etc. One potential solution to address this issue is to get more test data. By having more test data, the model can generalize better and reduce its variance. This is because the test data represents a different distribution than the training data, and the model can learn to generalize better to unseen data.

Dashboards monitor live, incoming data from multiple datasets and organize the information into one central location. Reports are static collections of data.\n\nDefinition:\n\nDashboards are visual displays of data and information that provide a high-level snapshot of a particular topic or topic area. They are interactive, allowing users to drill down into the underlying data to explore more detailed information. Dashboards are designed to quickly and easily present key performance indicators (KPIs) and other important metrics to stakeholders so they can rapidly understand and respond to key business issues.\n\nReports, on the other hand, are static collections of data that are usually created for internal use only. They consist of records or data collected from various data sources and are typically not interactive. Reports provide detailed information and insights into specific business areas and help stakeholders make informed decisions.\n\nExample:\nA company might use a dashboard to monitor sales data and customer engagement. The dashboard would display key metrics such as daily sales, weekly revenue, and customer satisfaction scores. By clicking on each metric, users can drill down into the underlying data to view more detailed information, such as individual customer demographics or specific product sales. Reports, on the other hand, might provide a detailed analysis of sales performance by region, product category, or month. The reports would be used to inform strategic decision-making and have limited interactive functionality.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn summary, dashboards and reports serve different purposes in data analytics. Dashboards are dynamic, interactive, and provide a high-level snapshot of data, while reports are static, detailed collections of data that provide more in-depth insights into specific business areas. Knowing the difference between these tools can help organizations make informed decisions and make the most of their data analysis capabilities.", "evaluation": "exam"}

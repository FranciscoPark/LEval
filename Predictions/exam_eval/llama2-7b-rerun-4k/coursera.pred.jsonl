Communicating with your team\nHey, welcome back. So far you've learned about things like spreadsheets, analytical thinking skills, metrics, and mathematics. These are all super important technical skills that you'll build on throughout your Data Analytics career. You should also keep in mind that there are some non-technical skills that you can use to create a positive and productive working environment. These skills will help you consider the way you interact with your colleagues as well as your stakeholders. We already know that it's important to keep your team members' and stakeholders' needs in mind. Coming up, we'll talk about why that is. We'll start learning some communication best practices you can use in your day to day work. Remember, communication is key. We'll start by learning all about effective communication, and how to balance team member and stakeholder needs. Think of these skills as new tools that'll help you work with your team to find the best possible solutions. Alright, let's head on to the next video and get started.\n\nBalancing needs and expectations across your team\nAs a data analyst, you'll be required to focus on a lot of different things, And your stakeholders' expectations are one of the most important. We're going to talk about why stakeholder expectations are so important to your work and look at some examples of stakeholder needs on a project. By now you've heard me use the term stakeholder a lot. So let's refresh ourselves on what a stakeholder is. Stakeholders are people that have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you'll be working on as a data analyst. In other words, they hold stakes in what you're doing. There's a good chance they'll need the work you do to perform their own needs. That's why it's so important to make sure your work lines up with their needs and why you need to communicate effectively with all of the stakeholders across your team. Your stakeholders will want to discuss things like the project objective, what you need to reach that goal, and any challenges or concerns you have. This is a good thing. These conversations help build trust and confidence in your work. Here'", "evaluation": "exam"}

Version Control\nNow that we've got a handle on our RStudio and projects, there are a few more things we want to set you up with before moving on to the other courses, understanding version control, installing Git, and linking Git with RStudio. In this lesson, we will give you a basic understanding of version control. First things first, what is version control? Version control is a system that records changes that are made to a file or a set of files over time. As you make edits, the version control system takes snapshots of your files and the changes and then saves those snapshots so you can refer, revert back to previous versions later if need be. If you've ever used the track changes in Microsoft Word, you have seen a rudimentary type of version control in which the changes to a file are tracked and you can only choose to keep those edits or revert to the original format. Version control systems like Git are like a more sophisticated track changes in that, they are far more powerful and are capable of meticulously tracking successive changes on many files with potentially many people working simultaneously on the same groups of files. Hopefully, once you've mastered version control software, paper final final two actually finaldoc.docx will be a thing of the past for you. As we've seen in this example, without version control, you might be keeping multiple, very similar copies of a file and this could be dangerous. You might start editing the wrong version not recognizing that the document labeled final has been further edited to final two and now all your new changes have been applied to the wrong file. Version control systems help to solve this problem by keeping a single updated version of each file with a record of all previous versions and a record of exactly what changed between the versions which brings us to the next major benefit of version control. It keeps a record of all changes made to the files. This can be of great help when you are collaborating with many people on the same files. The version control software keeps track of who, when, and why those specific changes were made. It's like track changes to the extreme. This record is also helpful when developing code.

Introduction to focus on integrity\nHi! Good to see you! My name is Sally, and I'm here to teach you all about processing data. I'm a measurement and analytical lead at Google. My job is to help advertising agencies and companies measure success and analyze their data, so I get to meet with lots of different people to show them how data analysis helps with their advertising. Speaking of analysis, you did great earlier learning how to gather and organize data for analysis. It's definitely an important step in the data analysis process, so well done! Now let's talk about how to make sure that your organized data is complete and accurate. Clean data is the key to making sure your data has integrity before you analyze it. We'll show you how to make sure your data is clean and tidy. Cleaning and processing data is one part of the overall data analysis process. As a quick reminder, that process is Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. Which means it's time for us to explore the Process phase, and I'm here to guide you the whole way. I'm very familiar with where you are right now. I'd never heard of data analytics until I went through a program similar to this one. Once I started making progress, I realized how much I enjoyed data analytics and the doors it could open. And now I'm excited to help you open those same doors! One thing I realized as I worked for different companies, is that clean data is important in every industry. For example, I learned early in my career to be on the lookout for duplicate data, a common problem that analysts come across when cleaning. I used to work for a company that had different types of subscriptions. In our data set, each user would have a new row for each subscription type they bought, which meant users would show up more than once in my data. So if I had counted the number of users in a table without accounting for duplicates like this, I would have counted some users twice instead of once. As a result, my analysis would have been wrong, which would have led to problems in my reports and for the stakeholders relying on my analysis. Imagine if I told the CEO that we had twice as many customers as we actually did!? That'", "evaluation": "exam"}

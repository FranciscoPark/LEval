Please directly give the answer without any additional output or explanation [/INST]\nAnswer:", "llama2-7b-chat-moice4k_pred": " False [fact:  False.\n\nThe rapid development of technology has brought many benefits to humans, such as improved communication, transportation, and healthcare. However, it has also created new challenges, such as pollution, climate change, and the digital divide. While technology has the potential to improve the living environment in the future, it is unlikely to completely solve the environmental problems that humanity faces.\n\nSome of the reasons why the rapid development of technology may not lead to a better living environment in the future include:\n\n1. Climate change: Despite the development of clean energy technologies, the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities continue to contribute to climate change, which poses significant risks to human health and the environment.\n2. Pollution: The rapid growth of industries and transportation has led to increased pollution, which can have serious health impacts on humans and other living organisms.\n3. Digital divide: The unequal distribution of technology and access to it can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, leading to a widening gap between the digital haves and have-nots.\n4. Resource depletion: The rapid consumption of natural resources, such as fossil fuels, minerals, and water, can lead to their depletion, which can have serious consequences for human well-being and the environment.\n5. Unintended consequences: New technologies can have unintended consequences, such as the displacement of workers by automation, which can lead to social and economic disruption.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology has the potential to improve the living environment in the future, it is unlikely to completely solve the environmental problems that humanity faces. It is important to address these challenges through a combination of technological innovation and sustainable practices that prioritize the well-being of both humans and the environment.</s>]", "evaluation": "exam"}

We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: \"Fear of dying alone.\" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation \"manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,\" Herman argues\u2014like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. \"It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company \u2026 missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades\" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \"There already is an apple,\" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that \"Microsoft needed to make a bold move\" or face \"certain terminal decline,\" and that the price it paid for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable.\" Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform\u2014a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move\u2014to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone.

The court\u2014which is divided 5-4 for conservatives, but saw Justice Roberts vote liberal on Obamacare and same-sex marriage\u2014will look at cases including unions, affirmative action, and possibly abortion. A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. \"It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\" a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008. The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional. \"One person, one vote\": Should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters? If justices choose the latter\u2014leaving out immigrants and children\u2014Latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain, Politico reports.

Cory Booker says he has ordered his staff to release a Kavanaugh email even though it's supposed to remain under wraps. It's not clear yet what the email says, but NBC News reports that it concerns racial profiling. Booker called his act one of civil disobedience, reports NPR. \"I openly invite and accept the consequences,\" he said, per CNN. \"The penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.\" Indeed, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn read aloud rules stating that a senator who divulges \"the secret or confidential business\" of the Senate faces expulsion, reports the Washington Post. \"Bring the charges,\" said Booker. \"All of us are ready to face that rule,\" added fellow Democrat Richard Blumenthal. Democrats have been chafing that too many of Kavanaugh's documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing. Booker's stand comes after the New York Times obtained some of those off-limits emails. In one from 2003, when Kavanaugh was working in the White House of George W. Bush, he objects to language that Roe v. Wade is \"settled law.\" He was going over a draft opinion stating that \"it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land,\" but he took exception to the phrase. \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,\" he wrote at the time.

Kavanaugh had written in a 2002 email that security procedures should be race-neutral, but others in the White House suggested that racial profiling might be justified for enhanced security. In a 2001 email, Kavanaugh also criticized a Department of Transportation affirmative action program as a \"naked racial set-aside.\" He clarified during the hearings that his hopes for a color-blind society have not been fulfilled and that racism still exists in the United States.\n\nAnother leaked email from 2003 showed Kavanaugh questioning whether the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision should be described as \"settled law.\" Kavanaugh clarified that he was summarizing the views of legal scholars and not offering his own opinion on the matter. Throughout the hearings, Kavanaugh avoided commenting on President Trump's behavior and declined to condemn Trump's attacks on the judiciary, stating that judges should stay out of politics and not comment on comments made by politicians.\n\nThe release of the committee confidential emails by Booker and Hirono sparked a debate about access to Kavanaugh's records.

{"query": "Please summarize these news articles.", "gt": "\u2013 Frat-house accidents and sexual assaults are getting so common they're impossible to ignore\u2014but how did it get this bad, and why does it keep happening? In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University\u2014and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow\u2014so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives\u2014like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training. But parents should know the dangers: \"Until proven otherwise,\" a lawyer tells Flanagan, \"they all are very risky organizations for young people to be involved in.\" Click for her full piece.", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

The first article focuses on attorney Douglas Fierberg, who specializes in fraternity lawsuits. Fierberg is described as intelligent and dedicated to seeking justice for victims of fraternity-related incidents. However, he is also criticized by fraternity members who see him as motivated by financial gain rather than genuine reform. The second article discusses a lawsuit filed by Louis Helmburg III against the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity after sustaining injuries from falling off an elevated deck without a railing. The lawsuit faces challenges in finding defendants willing to take responsibility for the incident. The third article tells the story of Amanda Andaverde, who suffered severe injuries after falling out of an open window in a fraternity house. Her case was dismissed due to no evidence of an inherently dangerous condition and no duty of protection from others. The final article presents contrasting perspectives on fraternities. Fierberg argues that fraternities pose significant risks due to their flawed risk-management policies and alcohol-fueled environments. On the other hand, Peter Smithhisler, a senior figure in the fraternity world, believes that fraternities can provide valuable experiences for young men in terms of leadership, accountability, and personal growth.", "source_documents": ["Fraternal Information and Programming Group.

At least seven states have now declared a state of emergency, and hundreds of flights are being canceled. Gas stations are running out of fuel and ATMs have been emptied of cash as Americans hit the road for a bumper-to-bumper trip out of Irene's angry path. The Category 3 storm is expected to hit the Southeast sometime tomorrow, and hundreds of thousands of residents have been ordered out of their homes in three North Carolina counties. Norfolk, Va., is also ordering residents to evacuate, and Washington, DC, has been forced to postpone Sunday's planned MLK Memorial dedication. \"This is a very, very serious situation,\" a spokeswoman for Dare County told ABC News. \"We have not seen anything like this in the lifetimes of most our residents. Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today. NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg says residents in low-lying parts of the city should get out today as the transit system is planned to be shut down tomorrow.", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

The storm has already hit the Bahamas, causing damage to homes and flooding. With a projected path similar to Hurricane Gloria in 1985, Irene could result in insured losses of up to $13.9 billion and affect more than 65 million people along the East Coast. Evacuation orders have been issued in various states, including North Carolina, where up to 200,000 tourists and residents are affected. Some individuals are choosing to ride out the storm, while others are taking precautions and leaving high-risk areas. New York City has declared a state of emergency and is preparing for the storm by deploying boats and helicopters, testing emergency generators at hospitals, and stockpiling supplies. Amtrak has canceled train services in parts of the East Coast, and there are concerns about power outages, interrupted transportation, and economic losses due to the storm. Forecasters predict Irene could reach Category 4 status but expect it to diminish to Category 2 before hitting Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware. The storm is moving slowly, which increases the risk of it hovering over an area and causing extensive damage. Government officials, including President Obama, have declared emergencies and are coordinating with various agencies to provide assistance and resources for affected areas.

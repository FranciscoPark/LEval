{"query": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper.", "gt": "Conventional out-of-distribution (OOD) detection schemes based on variational autoencoder or Random Network Distillation (RND) have been observed to assign lower uncertainty to the OOD than the target distribution. In this work, we discover that such conventional novelty detection schemes are also vulnerable to the blurred images. Based on the observation, we construct a novel RND-based OOD detector, SVD-RND, that utilizes blurred images during training. Our detector is simple, efficient at test time, and outperforms baseline OOD detectors in various domains. Further results show that SVD-RND learns better target distribution representation than the baseline RND algorithm. Finally, SVD-RND combined with geometric transform achieves near-perfect detection accuracy on the CelebA dataset.", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

The authors propose a new OOD detection model called SVD-RND, which is trained using the concept of Random Network Distillation (RND) to distinguish between original and blurred versions of the training data. Experimental results demonstrate that SVD-RND outperforms conventional OOD detection methods across various challenging scenarios, significantly improving detection accuracy. This approach addresses the limitations of deep generative models in OOD detection and provides a more effective and robust solution. Overall, SVD-RND shows promising results in OOD detection tasks and contributes to the field of representation learning.", "source_documents": ["as OOD SVD, and denote the result on RND as OOD RND. 5 FURTHER ANALYSIS\nIn this section, we examine ...", "detection. 3.1 GENERATING BLURRED DATA\nIn this work, blurred images function as adversarial examples...", "show significant performance gains in CelebA : (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) domains. 6 CONCLUSION\nIn this w...", "1 INTRODUCTION\nOut-of distribution (OOD) or novelty detection aims to distinguish samples in unseen ..."]}

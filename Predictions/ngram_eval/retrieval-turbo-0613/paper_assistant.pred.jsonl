In this section, we mention only closely related work to our research. For a broader survey on deep OOD detection, we recommend the paper from Chalapathy et al. (2019). OOD Detection: Majority of OOD detection methods rely on a reconstruction error and representation learning. (Ruff et al., 2018) trained a deep neural network to map data into a minimum volume hypersphere. Generative probabilistic novelty detection (GPND) (Pidhorskyi et al., 2018) employed the distance to the latent data manifold as the confidence measure and trained the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to model the manifold. Deep generative models are widely employed for latent space modeling in OOD detection (Zenati et al., 2018; Sabokrou et al., 2018). However, a recent paper by Nalisnick et al. (2019) discovered that popular deep generative models, such as variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma et al., 2014) or GLOW (Kingma et al., 2018), fail to detect simple OOD. While adversarially trained generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) or AAE, are not discussed in Nalisnick et al.

One popular approach is to utilize deep generative models, such as generative adversarial nets (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and adversarial autoencoders (AAE) (Pidhorskyi et al., 2018), for OOD detection. These models are capable of modeling high-dimensional data and have been widely applied in novelty detection (Choi et al., 2018; Kingma et al., 2014; Schlegl et al., 2017).\n\nHowever, the OOD detection performance of deep generative models has been questioned due to their tendency to assign higher likelihood to OOD data compared to training data (Nalisnick et al., 2019). To address this issue, researchers have proposed various solutions.\n\nOne line of research focuses on improving the robustness of deep generative models to adversarial examples. Adversarial examples have been shown to fool classifiers, and training classifiers against adversarial attacks can effectively detect unknown adversarial attacks (Tramer et al., 2018). Inspired by this, Burda et al. (2019) proposed the Random Network Distillation (RND) algorithm for novelty detection. RND trains a predictor network to minimize the L2 distance with a randomly initialized target network on the in-distribution data. By reducing the distance between the predictor and target networks only on in-distribution data, RND can naturally distinguish between in-distribution and OOD data.\n\nAnother approach to improve OOD detection performance is through the use of blurred data as adversarial examples. Blurring has been observed to increase the confidence of novelty detection schemes on the blurred data compared to the original data (Nalisnick et al., 2019). Motivated by this observation, the proposed algorithm SVD-RND utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to generate blurred versions of the training data and trains the RND model to discriminate between the original and blurred data. This approach has shown significant performance gains in challenging scenarios where vanilla generative models struggle, such as CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN and ImageNet vs. CIFAR-10 (Nalisnick et al., 2019).\n\nIn addition to the above approaches, researchers have explored other techniques for OOD detection. These include geometric transforms such as flip, rotation, translation, and shearing (Golan et al., 2018), as well as pixel inversion, contrast reduction, and shearing (Cubuk et al., 2019). Furthermore, Nalisnick et al. (2019) proposed a typicality test that measures the distance between the mean log likelihood of the generative model on training data and the test data.\n\nOverall, these works contribute to the advancement of OOD detection by proposing novel techniques to address the limitations of deep generative models and improve the performance of OOD detection algorithms.", "source_documents": ["blurring.

They train a model f(x) to match the outputs of g_i(aug_i(x)), where g_i is a random network and aug_i is a particular type of augmentation. An example with high error in this task is treated as an out-of-distribution example. This work focuses on exploring blurring through SVD, where the smallest K singular values are set to 0, and K varies between different aug_i calls. They find that their method of consistently can achieve strong detection rates across multiple target-dataset pairs.\n\nComments:\n* The experimental results in this work are impressive, which introduces many more questions.\n* The model used for f and g is not mentioned in the text.\n* Figure 4 (left) suggests that the SVD-RND performs about the same between 10K and 50K examples. The level of robustness is surprising, but doesn\u2019t seem to square with intuition that more data ought to help. How little data can be used? In other words, extend the graph to the left. \n* The geometric transforms baseline is not fair, since SVD-RND uses multiple SVD transforms (b_train > 1) whereas the geometric transforms only have one. Please run a model with all the geometric transforms. This result is important for understanding whether the gains come from the particular transform (SVD) or the number of transforms used.\n* Following the spirit of the previous comment, what other data augmentations can be used in place of SVD? Typical image classification pipelines use a large variety of augmentations. I would suggest taking some augmentations from AutoAugment [1] and running RND on top of them.\n* An experiment that is missing is RND trained on blurred images. Is the blurring itself the important component, or is having multiple different heads important?\n* In general, I am confused about how a single head RND does not converge to 0 loss by learning the weights of g. This seems to be a simple optimization problem. The original RND paper avoided this problem by also using the network to learn a policy, but this does not exist in this approach.\n\nIn general, this work seems promising, but lacks proper ablations that elucidate what components of the method are important.

Consequently, as supervised techniques for depth estimation advanced rapidly, the availability of largescale depth labels became a bottleneck, especially for outdoor applications. Garg et al. (2016) and Godard et al. (2017) provided an alternative self-supervised strategy involving stereo cameras, where Spatial Transformer Networks (Jaderberg et al., 2015) can be used to geometrically warp, in a differentiable way, the right image into a synthesized left image, using the predicted depth from the left image. The photometric consistency loss between the resulting synthesized and original left images can then be minimized in an end-to-end manner using a Structural Similarity term (Wang et al., 2004) and additional depth regularization terms. Following Godard et al. (2017) and Ummenhofer et al. (2017), Zhou et al. (2017) generalized this to the purely monocular setting, where a depth and a pose networks are simultaneously learned from unlabeled monocular videos. Rapid progress in terms of architectures and objective functions (Yin & Shi, 2018; Mahjourian et al., 2018; Casser et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2018; Klodt & Vedaldi, 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018) have since then turned monocular depth estimation into one of the most successful applications of self-supervised learning, even outperforming supervised methods (Guizilini et al., 2019). The introduction of semantic information to improve depth estimates has been explored in prior works, and can be broadly divided into two categories. The first one uses semantic (or instance) information to mask out or properly model dynamic portions of the image, which are not accounted for in the photometric loss calculation.

Therefore, rather than continuously polling training loss until it reaches a certain threshold, in this experiment we chose to evaluate speed of convergence by measuring the training loss once after a predetermined number of iterations. the success of landscape-driven analyses in formally proving convergence to global minimum for a gradient-based algorithm, has thus far been limited to shallow (two layer) models only (e.g. Ge et al.

From my understanding, this paper circumvents this problem by assuming deficiency margin, because in the setting of [Shamir 18\u2019], deficiency margin means that the initialized product ($W_{1:N}$) has the same sign as $\\Phi$ and far enough from zero, so we don\u2019t have to pass through the near-zero region.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll list specific concerns/questions/comments.\n* In my opinion, the statements about \u201cnecessity\u201d of two key assumptions are too strong, because the authors only provide counterexamples of non-convergence. As [Theorem 3, Shamir 18\u2019] shows (although in scalar case), even when the assumptions are not satisfied, a convergence rate $O(exp(N) * log(1/\\epsilon))$ is possible.

Bayesian Compression and Structured Bayesian Pruning (Louizos et al., 2017; Neklyudov et al., 2017) extend Sparse VD to prune whole neurons or filters via groupsparsity constraints. Additionally, in Bayesian Compression the required bit-precision per layer is determined via the posterior variance. In contrast to our method, Bayesian Compression does not explicitly enforce clustering of weights during training and thus requires bit-widths in the range between 5 and 18 bits. Extending our method to include group-constraints for pruning is an interesting direction for future work. Another Bayesian method for simultaneous network quantization and pruning is soft weight-sharing (SWS) (Ullrich et al., 2017), which uses a Gaussian mixture model prior (and a KL term without trainable parameters such that the KL term reduces to the prior entropy). SWS acts like a probabilistic version of k-means clustering with the advantage of automatic collapse of unnecessary mixture components. Similar to learning the codebooks in our method, soft weight-sharing learns the prior from the data, a technique known as empirical Bayes. We cannot directly compare against soft weight-sharing since the authors do not report results on ternary networks. Gal et al.

Existing works rely on choosing between a menu of pre-specified module primitives, using different module types to solve subproblems involving specific input-output datatypes, without addressing how these modules\u2019 forms are to be discovered in the first place. In this paper, we show a single generic module architecture is capable of automatically learning to solve a wide variety of different tasks in a unified action/state space, and a simple controller scheme is able to switch between such modules. Our results are also closely connected with the literature on lifelong (or continual) learning (Kirkpatrick et al., 2016; Rusu et al., 2016). A part of this literature is concerned with learning to solve new tasks without catastrophically forgetting how to solve old ones (Zenke et al., 2017; Kirkpatrick et al., 2016). The use of modules obviates this problem, but instead shifts the hard question to one of how newly-allocated modules can be learned effectively. The continual learning literature also directly addresses knowlege transfer to newly allocated structures (Chen et al., 2015; Rusu et al., 2016; Fernando et al., 2017), but largely addresses how transfer learning can lead to higher performance, rather than addressing how it can improve learning speed.

To that end, we leverage the posterior regularization framework and show that this constraint satisfaction problem can be formulated as sampling from a Gibbs distribution. The main challenges come from the black-box nature of those physical constraints, since they are obtained via solving highly non-linear PDEs. To overcome those difficulties, we introduce Surrogate-based Constrained Langevin dynamics for black-box sampling. We explore two surrogate approaches. The first approach exploits zero-order approximation of gradients in the Langevin Sampling and we refer to it as Zero-Order Langevin. In practice, this approach can be prohibitive since we still need to often query the expensive PDE solvers.

(2019) introduced recently for black-box sampling from log concave density. The main difference in our setting, is that the density has a compact support and hence the need to appeal to projected LMC (Bubeck et al., 2015) and Proximal LMC (Brosse et al., 2017). It is worth nothing that Hsieh et al. (2018) introduced recently mirror Langevin sampling that can also be leveraged in our framework. Gradients and Score functions Estimators. We used the approach of gradient distillation (Srinivas & Fleuret, 2018) and learning gradients of (Wu et al., 2010), since they are convenient for training on different constraints and they come with theoretical guarantees. However, other approaches can be also leveraged such as the score matching approach for learning the gradient of the log likelihood (Hyv\u00e4rinen, 2005) and other variants appealing to dual embeddings (Dai et al., 2018). Estimating gradients can be also performed using Stein\u2019s method as in (Li & Turner, 2017), or via maintaining a surrogate of the gradient as in Stein descent without gradient (Han & Liu, 2018).

They consider the specific situation where the constraints are a solution of a complicated PDE solver and hence the derivatives or specific functional forms of the constraint cannot be obtained. They repose the problem as sampling from a Gibbs distribution whose potential contains constraints as penalties in a Lagrangian fashion. They now wish to sample from the Gibbs distribution using Langevin diffusion.  The Langevin process requires a derivative of the gradient. The setting does not allow for that and therefore the authors propose two approaches - \n\n1. Constructing the gradient from zeroth order entries of a gaussian smoothed potential (much like works of Nesterov et al on zero order optimization). \n2. Using a parameteric function class (like an RKHS or a neural network) to learn a function which well approximates the gradient of the constraints as well given zeroth order constraint evaluations. \n\n\nThe theoretical analysis seems quite rigorous as it begins by first providing a basic guarantee for constrained langevin sampling when gradients are computed with error. The non error gradient part of this analysis has been established before and the authors mention the references appropriately. I have a couple of questions regarding the precise statements of the theorem that i will ask towards the end of the review. Overall its hard to comment on the tightness of the analysis as the non-error versions are also unclear of the tightness of the bounds. Nevertheless the bounds achieved do not look much worse than the non-error counterparts and are easy to implement. The rest of the bounds focus on achieving low error in approximation of the gradients in various settings. Overall the theory in this part seems very loose in terms of bounds as exponential factors in dimensions start to appear and in that regard seems quite preliminary but its hard to comment on whether its natural or can be improved. \n\nSome questions I have regarding the theorem statements \n\nRegarding theorem 1 SPLMC convergence  (and corollaries of the theorem) -  I find it surprising that there is no lower bound assumption on eta in terms of K - only an upper bound. This seems wrong particularly as the theorem as stated then allows eta to be set extremely small while K is finite, in which case there should be no convergence theorems at all. The condition on eta should be a theta(f (K)) for some f type of condition like in the second part of the theorem. I would suggest the authors to look into the theorem - or claify why this is the case. \n\nI am confused by the presentation of the Shi et al results as there is no penalty appearing for the approximation error due to an RKHS, only a finite sample penalty.

Sequential Monte Carlo (Liu & Chen, 1998) approximates the posterior by a set of particles. Assumed Density Filtering (ADF) (Maybeck, 1982) and Bayesian online learning (Opper, 1998) are deterministic posterior approximations based on moment matching. Other deterministic approaches are based on Laplace\u2019s approximation (MacKay, 1992): Kirkpatrick et al. (2017) use multiple diagonal Gaussian posterior approximations of previous time-steps to regularise future tasks; Ritter et al. (2018) use a single (block-diagonal) posterior approximation, summarising all previous time-steps. The latter method is closer to Bayesian online inference, as it is an approximation of Eq. (1). Our work is based on online VB (Opper, 1998; Ghahramani, 2000; Sato, 2001; Broderick et al., 2013), which approximates the posterior at every time-step by minimising the KL-divergence between a parametric (here Gaussian) and the true posterior distribution. In contrast to online VB, we approximate the posterior by a Gaussian distribution and a running memory. Other approaches are based on various types of episodic memory, motivated by their empirical success in preventing catastrophic forgetting. The basic idea of rehearsal (Ratcliff, 1990) is to train on both the new data and a subset of previous data or pseudo samples (Robins, 1995; Shin et al., 2017; Kemker & Kanan, 2017) sampled from a generative model. The memory-based online inference methods most similar to our approach are VCL (Nguyen et al., 2018) and VVM (Minka et al., 2009). Both methods use a Gaussian distribution and a running memory to approximate the posterior. VCL uses heuristics such as random selection or the k-center method to update the memory.", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

(2013) introduces streaming variational Bayes, which enables efficient Bayesian inference in settings with streaming data. Ghahramani (2000) proposes online variational Bayesian learning, which approximates the posterior distribution using variational methods and is applicable to non-trivial models.

Summary:\nThis proposes considers neural networks training with non-stationary streaming data. To address online inference, the paper uses variational online updates and a running memory (coreset) summarising the data points seen so far, as recently used in the variational continual learning approach. First, the paper identifies a gap in this recent approach that coreset point selection process does not take into account the approximation quality. The paper develops a sound procedure to select the memory points, essentially to identify \u201cdifficult\u201d data points under the current posterior and put them into the running memory. Second, to handle \u201cconcept drift\u201d, the paper considers imposing some decaying on the likelihood of past data and derives post-hoc variational posterior updates for this case. Two contributions are validated on some streaming regression and classification tasks.\n\n2. Opinion and rationales\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards \u201caccept\u201d for this paper since it presents two interesting contributions (albeit of incremental novelty)  to the approximate inference area, it has clear execution and super clean presentation, and the experiments clearly demonstrate the values of the proposed approaches.\n\nI would like the paper to clarify the following:\n\na. I find the objective for selecting memory points interesting, but am wondering if using individual predictability terms by themselves are good enough to select these points. Perhaps, after some thoughts, memory is perhaps not the right word to characterise these points. \n\nIt seems to me (i) these terms indicate how well the current posterior predicts the data points and thus this objective will tend to favour points with low predictive likelihood to be selected. That is, these points are important when *all other points* are presented, (ii) there will be *no diversity* in the memory as illustrated in the 2d classification example.\n\nThis means the points selected here have quite different characteristics compared to coreset points or the full dataset in general. Coreset points ideally can compactly represent the full dataset and can be used for inference in place of the full dataset.\n\nThat said, the contribution presented here is very useful. Just that I\u2019m not sure how well this will work in more challenging continual learning set-up where diversity is important for a long sequence of diverse tasks.\n\nb. The paper presents a post-hoc modification to approximate posterior (\u2018s mean and variance) to account for the decay in the likelihood contribution from past data. I wonder if this post-hoc adjustment is identical to running approximate inference with the adjusted likelihood?\n\nc. the adaptation parameters need to be tuned/known in advance, which seems to be a disadvantage of the current approach. Is the update presented here somewhat robust to mis-specification of these parameters? How would these be tuned in a more practical setting in which data arrive sequentially and we might not know the underlying \u201cconcept\u201d.\n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

The main goal of GRS is to improve the predictive performance of Bayesian neural networks in scenarios with streaming data and concept drift.\n\nThe authors provide a thorough evaluation of GRS using two metrics - the average test log-marginal likelihood (LML) and the average one-step-ahead LML. These metrics measure the predictive performance of the models on both stationary and non-stationary streaming data. The authors also compare GRS to other memory update and Gaussian update methods proposed in previous work.\n\nThe experimental results show that GRS outperforms the other methods in terms of predictive performance. The authors attribute this improvement to the memory update step, which selects data for which the model has a low predictive LML. This suggests that the memory is complementary to the Gaussian approximation used in Bayesian neural networks.\n\nThe paper also discusses the limitations of GRS and suggests future research directions. One limitation is that the Gaussian approximation used in GRS can lead to poor local minima for small datasets and complex models. The authors suggest exploring alternative approximation families beyond Gaussians to overcome this limitation. They also mention the issue of over-regularization in Bayesian neural networks with VB, which can affect the performance of GRS when using refitting.

This would make it easier for other researchers to reproduce the experiments and compare their own methods to GRS. Additionally, including a discussion on the interpretability of the selected memory and its impact on decision-making could also be valuable.\n\nSome questions raised by this paper include whether GRS can be applied to other types of models beyond Bayesian neural networks.

In recent years a great deal of work was done in applications of tensor calculus to both theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning algorithms. (Lebedev et al., 2015) represented filters in a convolutional network with CP decomposition (Harshman, 1970; Carroll & Chang, 1970) which allowed for much faster inference at the cost of a negligible drop in performance. (Novikov et al., 2015) proposed to use Tensor Train (TT) decomposition (Oseledets, 2011) to compress fully\u2013connected layers of large neural networks while preserving their expressive power. Later on, TT was exploited to reduce the number of parameters and improve the performance of recurrent networks in long\u2013term forecasting (Yu et al., 2017) and video classification (Yang et al., 2017) problems. In addition to the practical benefits, tensor decompositions were used to analyze theoretical aspects of deep neural nets. (Cohen et al., 2016) investigated a connection between various network architectures and tensor decompositions, which made possible to compare their expressive power. Specifically, it was shown that CP and Hierarchial Tucker (Grasedyck, 2010) decompositions correspond to shallow networks and convolutional networks respectively. Recently, this analysis was extended by (Khrulkov et al., 2018) who showed that TT decomposition can be represented as a recurrent network with multiplicative connections. This specific form of RNNs was also empirically proved to provide a substantial performance boost over standard RNN models (Wu et al., 2016). First results on the connection between tensor decompositions and neural networks were obtained for rather simple architectures, however, later on, they were extended in order to analyze more practical deep neural nets. It was shown that theoretical results can be generalized to a large class of CNNs with ReLU nonlinearities (Cohen & Shashua, 2016) and dilated convolutions (Cohen et al., 2018), providing valuable insights on how they can be improved.", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

They found functions realized by ConvNets that require an exponentially large number of parameters to be realized by shallow nets. Similarly, Khrulkov et al.

They showed the efficacy of tensor train decomposition in speeding up convolutional neural networks and tensorizing neural networks. These approaches utilize the concept of tensor train decomposition for efficient parameterization.\n\nIn the area of tensor analysis, Lars Grasedyck (2019) focused on hierarchical singular value decomposition of tensors. This work provided foundational principles and techniques for analyzing tensor structures.

The authors highlight the need for further understanding of the theoretical foundations behind the depth efficiency of RNNs. They reference previous work on the expressivity of ConvNets and multiplicative RNNs, and state their objective of applying generalized tensor decompositions to RNNs with rectifier nonlinearities.\n\nThe authors then provide an overview of the architectures inspired by tensor decompositions, such as score functions and feature tensors. They explain the preprocessing of sequential data using a parametric feature map and discuss the assumptions that hold for various types of data, such as natural images.\n\nTo support their theoretical findings, the authors conduct experiments using computer vision datasets and a natural language processing dataset. They evaluate the performance of generalized shallow networks and RNNs with rectifier nonlinearities on the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis. The results show that a significantly higher rank is required for the generalized shallow network to achieve performance comparable to the generalized RNN. Additional experiments on visual datasets are mentioned in Appendix B.\n\nIn terms of expressivity, the authors generate generalized RNNs with different values of TT-rank and calculate a lower bound on the rank of the shallow network necessary to realize the same grid tensor. The results demonstrate that for different values of R and corresponding ranks of generalized RNNs, there exist shallow networks of rank 1 that can achieve the same grid tensor. This is in agreement with Theorem 5.3. However, it is noted that increasing the rank of generalized RNNs leads to exponentially higher ranks of corresponding shallow networks.\n\nBased on the findings, it is suggested that effectively any function realized by generalized RNNs with realistic hidden state dimensions can only be implemented by exponentially wider shallow networks. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their analysis and provide additional numerical results for the case of shared cores and other nonlinearities in Appendix B.\n\nOverall, this paper presents a thorough analysis of the expressive power and depth efficiency of RNNs with rectifier nonlinearities.

For example, Feynman-Kac Formalism can be used to improve robustness (Wang et al., 2018). In this paper, we focus on the classification setting, where the goal is to provide guarantee of a constant prediction among a small region specified via some metric. The robustness certificate can be either exact or conservative, so long as a constant prediction is guaranteed in the certified region. Note that the certification of a completely black-box model requires checking the prediction values at every point around the point of interest, which is clearly infeasible. A practical certification algorithm inevitably has to specify and leverage the functional structure of the classifier in use to reduce the required computation. Exact certificates. The exact certificate of deep networks is typically derived for the networks with a piecewise linear activation function such as ReLU. Such networks have an equivalent mixed integer linear representation (Cheng et al., 2017; Lomuscio & Maganti, 2017; Dutta et al., 2017; Bunel et al., 2018). Hence, one may apply mixed integer linear programming to find the worst case adversary within any convex polyhedron such as an `1-ball or `\u221e-ball. Despite the elegant solution, the complexity is, in general, NP-hard and the algorithms are not scalable to large problems(Tjeng et al., 2017). Conservative certificates. A conservative certificate can be more scalable than the exact methods, since one can trade-off the accuracy of certification with efficiency (Gouk et al., 2018; Tsuzuku et al., 2018; Cisse et al., 2017; Anil et al., 2018; Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017). For example, one can relax the search of the worst case adversary as a simpler optimization problem that only bounds the effect of such adversary. Alternatively, people also consider the robustness problem in a modular way, where the robustness guarantee can be derived iteratively for each layer in the deep networks by considering the feasible values for each hidden layer (Gowal et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018).", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Some recent studies have developed more complicated regularization approaches to continuous control tasks. Cheng et al. (2019) regularizes the stochastic action distribution \u03c0(a|s) using a suboptimal control prior. The regularization weight at a given state is adjusted based on the temporal difference (TD) error. The larger the TD error, the more the action distribution moves towards the prior. Galashov et al. (2019) introduces a default policy that receives limited information as a regularizer. The information asymmetry between the behavior policy and the default policy helps to accelerate convergence and improve performance. Parisi et al.

The major difference between R-Transformer and the original Transformer is the replacement of positional embedding with an RNN layer, but (in my opinion) the authors did not demonstrate sufficiently its effectiveness via ablative studies (see below).

The problem of covariate shift was already observed, as the author notes: \u201cthe network must not solely be shown examples of accurate driving, but also how to recover once a mistake has been made\u201d. This issue was formalized in the work of (Ross & Bagnell, 2010), who on one hand proved an O( T 2) regret bound, and on the other hand provided an example showing this bound is tight. The subsequent work (Ross et al., 2011) proposed the DAGGER algorithm which obtains linear regret, provided the agent can both interact with the environment, and query the expert policy. Our approach also requires environment interaction, but importantly does not need to query the expert. note is the work of (Venkatraman et al., 2015), which extended DAGGER to time series prediction problems by using the true targets as expert corrections. Imitation learning has been used within the context of modern RL to help improve sample efficiency (Chang et al., 2015; Ross & Bagnell, 2014; Sun et al., 2017; Hester et al., 2018; Le et al., 2018; Cheng & Boots, 2018) or overcome exploration (Nair et al., 2017). These settings assume the reward is known and that the policies can then be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. In this case, covariate shift is less of an issue since it can be corrected using the reinforcement signal. The work of (Luo et al., 2019) also proposed a method to address the covariate shift problem when learning from demonstrations when the reward is known, by conservatively extrapolating the value function outside the training distribution using negative sampling. This addresses a different setting from ours, and requires generating plausible states which are off the manifold of training data, which may be challenging when the states are high dimensional such as images. The work of (Reddy et al., 2019) proposed to treat imitation learning within the Q-learning framework, setting a positive reward for all transitions inside the demonstration data and zero reward for all other transitions in the replay buffer. This rewards the agent for repeating (or returning to) the expert\u2019s transitions.", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

Such alternatives were not mentioned in the paper. Also, there are other quantities for measuring uncertainty besides the variance such as the entropy. These approaches and quantities have different pros and cons and they should be discussed in the paper.\n\n- Sample complexity in terms of environment interactions. \nThe sample complexity in terms of environment interactions is an important criterion for IL. I suggest the authors to include this criterion in the experiments. \n\n* Minor questions:\n- Why does the minibatch size is only 4 in the experiments for all methods.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty.

GuessWhat is one of the famous taskoriented dialog tasks, where the goal is to figure out a target object in the image through a dialog that the answerer has in mind (de Vries et al., 2017). However, GuessWhat is relatively an easy task because it only allows the answer form of yes or no. The baseline visual question answering (VQA) model achieves 78.5%. In the object guessing task (i.e., GuessWhat task itself), the state-of-the-art averaged accuracy of SL, RL (Zhang et al., 2018b), and AQM (Lee et al., 2018) reached 44.6% and 60.8%, and 72.9% at the 5th round, respectively. Random guessing baseline has an accuracy of\n16.0% (Han et al., 2017), thus RL algorithms achieve 53.3% error decrease, whereas AQM achieves 67.7%. GuessWhich is a cooperative two-player game that one player tries to figure out an image out of 9,628 that another has in mind (Das et al., 2017b). GuessWhich uses Visual Dialog dataset (Das et al., 2017a) which includes human dialogs on MSCOCO images (Lin et al., 2014) as well as the captions that are generated. Although GuessWhich is similar to GuessWhat, it is more challenging in every task including asking a question, giving an answer, and guessing the target class. For example, unlike GuessWhat that can be answered in yes or no, the answer can be an arbitrary sentence in GuessWhich. Therefore, the VQA task in the Visual Dialog dataset is much studied than the GuessWhat dataset (Lu et al., 2017; Seo et al., 2017b). Similar to GuessWhat, SL and RL approaches have been applied to solve the GuessWhich task and they showed a moderate increase in performance (Das et al., 2017b; Jain et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a). However, based on the authors\u2019 recent Github implementation1 of the papers in ICCV (Das et al., 2017b), SL and RL methods have shown that only 6% of error is diminished through the dialog compared to the zeroth turn baselines which only use generated caption.", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

One approach is the use of sequence-to-sequence models trained in a supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) fashion to generate appropriate responses (Vinyals & Le, 2015). However, these SL-based models typically require a large amount of training data and do not consider the sequential characteristic of the dialog, leading to inconsistencies (Li et al., 2017; Zhao & Eskenazi, 2016).\n\nTo address these issues, RL has been applied to task-oriented dialog problems (Strub et al., 2017; Das et al., 2017b). RL enables models to generate a consistent dialog by learning the intrinsic planning policy and reward function, but struggles with the complexity of learning a series of sentences (Lee et al., 2018).\n\nAs an alternative, Lee et al. (2018) proposed the Answerer in Questioners Mind (AQM) algorithm, which does not rely on the limited capacity of recurrent neural network (RNN) models to cover the entire dialog. AQM treats the problem as a twenty question game and selects the question that provides maximum information gain. It benefits from explicitly calculating the posterior distribution, leading to promising results in task-oriented dialog problems like GuessWhat (de Vries et al., 2017).\n\nHowever, the original AQM algorithm is not scalable to large-scale problems with a large number of candidates and varied questions and answers, such as GuessWhich (Das et al., 2017b). To address this limitation, the proposed AQM+ extends the AQM framework and employs an approximation based on subset sampling. AQM+ generates candidate questions and answers at every turn, considering the previous dialog history, to ask contextual questions.\n\nComparative analysis with other deep learning models has shown that AQM+ outperforms them significantly in the GuessWhich task, particularly in handling answers in sentence form and reducing errors (Lee et al., 2018). The performance improvement of AQM+ indicates the potential for further enhancement over SL and RL approaches.\n\nSeveral related papers have contributed to the field of task-oriented visual dialog. These include \"Learning cooperative visual dialog agents with deep reinforcement learning\" by Das et al. (2017), \"GuessWhat?! visual object discovery through multi-modal dialogue\" by de Vries et al. (2017), and \"Criteria for human-compatible AI in two-player vision-language tasks\" by Han et al. (2017). Other papers that have made significant contributions include \"Two can play this game: Visual dialog with discriminative question generation and answering\" by Jain et al. (2018), \"CODraw: Visual dialog for collaborative drawing\" by Kim et al. (2017), and \"Answerer in questioner's mind for goal-oriented visual dialogue\" by Lee et al. (2018).\n\nFurthermore, studies like \"Best of both worlds: Transferring knowledge from discriminative learning to a generative visual dialog model\" by Lu et al. (2017), \"Query-reduction networks for question answering\" by Seo et al. (2017), and \"Neural speed reading via skim-RNN\" by Seo et al. (2018) have explored approaches related to question generation and answering. Other works like \"Visual reference resolution using attention memory for visual dialog\" by Seo et al. (2017) and \"Multimodal hierarchical reinforcement learning policy for task-oriented visual dialog\" by Zhang et al. (2018) have focused on memory and reinforcement learning aspects in visual dialog tasks. Additionally, studies such as \"Goal-oriented visual question generation via intermediate rewards\" by Zhang et al. (2018) have investigated the generation of goal-oriented questions.\n\nLastly, the common objects in context (COCO) dataset (Lin et al., 2014) has been widely used as a benchmark for visual dialog tasks, and platforms like NSML (Kim et al., 2018) have provided valuable services for machine learning as a service. These works collectively contribute to the advancement of task-oriented visual dialog and provide important context for the proposed AQM+ algorithm.\n\nWord count: 395", "source_documents": ["1 INTRODUCTION\nRecent advances in deep learning have led an end-to-end neural approach to task-orien...", "by forgetting dialog context to ask an appropriate question.

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "The paper proposes an improvement over the AQM approach for an information-theoretic framework for task-oriented dialog systems. Specifically, the paper tries to circumvent the problem of explicitly calculating the information gain while asking a question in the AQM setting. While the original AQM approach sweeps over all possible guesses and answers while estimating information gain, this is rendered impractical in scenarios where this space cannot be tractably enumerated. As a solution, AQM+ proposes sweeping over only some top-k relevant instantiations of answers and guesses in this space by normalizing the probabilities of the subset of the space in consideration. \n\nComments:\n- The paper is overloaded with notations and the writing is not very smooth. The terse nature of the content makes it hard to follow in general. If someone apriori was not familiar with task-oriented dialog or the visual dialog setting in Das et al. (2017b), it would be quite hard to follow.\n- While mentioning SL/RL approaches while comparing or introducing the setup, the authors do not make any distinction between discriminative and generative dialog models. Specifically, SL approaches could either be trained discriminatively to rank options among the provided ones given dialog context or in a generative manner via token-level teacher forcing. The authors should clearly make this distinction in the introduction and in other places where it\u2019s needed.\n- The authors should stress more upon the approximations involved while calculating mutual information. As far as I understand, even in the AQM approach the numerator and the denominator within the logarithm are estimated from a different set of parameters and as such they need not be consistent with each other under marginalization. The term resembles MI and ensuring consistency in such a framework would require either of the numerator or the denominator to be close to something like a variational approximation of the true distribution. In addition, AQM+ adopts the same framework as AQM but computes MI over some top-k of the random variables being considered. Could the authors comment more on why restricting the space of r.v.\u2019s to some top-k samples is a good idea? Would that not lead to somewhat of a biased estimator?\n- Unless I am missing something, training aprxAgen from the training data (indA) seems odd. Assuming, this to be Qbot\u2019s mental model of Abot -- there is no prior reason why this should be initialized or trained in such a manner. Similarly, the training paradigm of the depA setting is confusing. If they are trained in a manner similar to a regular Abot -- either SL or RL -- then they\u2019re not approximate mental models but are rather just another Abot agent in play which is being queried by\n\n6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

For instance, the observed reward channel is often subject to noise in practice (e.g., when observed rewards are collected through sensors), and thus observed rewards may not be credible. Also, in applications such as robotics, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm can be manipulated to produce arbitrary errors. In this paper, we consider noisy RL problems where observed rewards by RL agents are generated with a reward confusion matrix. We call such observed rewards as perturbed rewards. We develop an unbiased reward estimator aided robust RL framework that enables RL agents to learn in noisy environments while observing only perturbed rewards. Our framework draws upon approaches for supervised learning with noisy data. The core ideas of our solution include estimating a reward confusion matrix and defining a set of unbiased surrogate rewards. We prove the convergence and sample complexity of our approach. Extensive experiments on different DRL platforms show that policies based on our estimated surrogate reward can achieve higher expected rewards, and converge faster than existing baselines.

Recent studies (Huang et al., 2017; Kos & Song, 2017; Lin et al., 2017) show that learned RL policies can be easily misled with small perturbations in observations. The presence of noise is very common in real-world environments, especially in robotics-relevant applications. Consequently, robust (adversarial) reinforcement learning (RRL/RARL) algorithms have been widely studied, aiming to train a robust policy which is capable of withstanding perturbed observations (Teh et al., 2017; Pinto et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2018) or transferring to unseen environments (Rajeswaran et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2017). However, these robust RL algorithms mainly focus on noisy vision observations, instead of the observed rewards. A couple of recent works (Lim et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2017) have also looked into a rather parallel question of training robust RL algorithms with uncertainty in models.

This paper represents a first step in gaining clarity on how to formalize and study this problem. I did, however, find the analysis and the experiments to be relatively disjointed -- the main sample complexity result presented by the paper (Theorem 2) was given for Phased Q-Learning, yet no experiments actually evaluate the performance of Phased Q-Learning. I think the paper could benefit from experiments focused on simple domains that showcase how traditional algorithms do in cases where it is easier to understand (and visualize) the impact of the reward perturbations (simple chain MDPs, grid worlds, etc.) -- and specifically experiments including Phased Q-Learning. \n\nSection 1) Introduction:\n\t- \"adversaries in real-world\" --> \"adversaries in the real-world\"\n\t- You might consider citing Loftin et al.

The authors propose a novel method for training reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the presence of noisy rewards. The proposed method uses surrogate rewards to guide the agent's learning process, overcoming the challenges posed by the noise in the reward signal. The authors provide theoretical analysis, experimental results, and comparisons with state-of-the-art RL algorithms to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of their approach.\n\nThe paper starts by introducing the problem of noisy rewards in RL. It discusses the limitations of existing methods and motivates the need for a new approach that can handle various types of noise, such as unary, binary, multivariate, and continuous rewards. The authors then present their Surrogate Reward Estimation (SRE) algorithm, which estimates the surrogate rewards based on the observed noisy rewards and a confusion matrix.\n\nThe theoretical analysis presented in the paper is rigorous and provides valuable insights into the sample complexity of the proposed method. The authors prove the upper bound for the number of samples needed for convergence to the optimal policy, considering both discounted and undiscounted MDP settings. The results show that the sample complexity is inversely proportional to the determinant of the reward confusion matrix, indicating that higher noise levels require more samples for convergence.\n\nThe experimental results presented in the paper are comprehensive and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method across different environments and noise levels. The authors compare their approach with several state-of-the-art RL algorithms, such as Q-Learning, CEM, SARSA, DQN, and DDQN. The results show that the proposed method achieves comparable or even better performance in terms of convergence speed and final scores, even in the presence of high noise levels.\n\nThe paper raises some interesting questions and provides suggestions for future research. For example, the authors mention the implicity exploration introduced by adding noise and then removing it in expectation. Exploring this further and understanding its role in improving convergence speed could be a valuable direction for future work. Additionally, the authors mention the limitation of the current work in considering only surrogate rewards and not explicitly modeling the noise process. Investigating methods to model and estimate the noise process could lead to even more robust RL algorithms.\n\nIn terms of suggestions, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide more details on the implementation of the proposed method, especially regarding the estimation of the confusion matrix.

In this paper we propose a retriever-reader model that learns to attend on essential terms during the question answering process.

Wang et al. (2018) proposed a Reinforced Ranker-Reader model that ranks retrieved evidence and assigns different weights to evidence prior to processing by the reader. Min et al. (2018) demonstrated that for several popular MRC datasets (e.g. SQuAD, TriviaQA) most questions can be answered using only a few sentences rather than the entire document. Motivated by this observation, they built a sentence selector to gather this potential evidence for use by the reader model. Nishida et al. (2018) developed a multi-task learning (MTL) method for a retriever and reader in order to obtain a strong retriever that considers certain passages including the answer text as positive samples during training. The proposed MTL framework is still limited to the scenario when it is feasible to discover whether the passages contain the answer span. Although these works have achieved progress on open-domain QA by improving the ranking or selection of given evidence, few have focused on the scenario where the model needs to start by searching for the evidence itself.

The above two proposed modules (reader and selector) are not very novel, but are still valid contributions to me. Experiments on the ARC dataset shows that (1) the proposed reader itself improves over the state-of-the-art on the leaderboard; (2) introducing the essential term selector further improves the above results by about 2%.\n\nAlthough the paper also provides additional experiments on other datasets, I feel that the contributions of the proposed methods are not sufficiently verified. I would suggest the authors consider the following further experiments that I believe could improve its ratings:\n\n(1) The proposed reader works very well on ARC. However, besides the BiDAF, there is no comparison between the proposed reader and previous models on datasets other than ARC. In order to know whether the result generalizes or not, I think the authors should conduct experiments on the regular RACE or other multi-choice QA datasets, to fully test the reader model.\n\n(2) It is not clear whether the essential term selector could help on datasets other than science questions. Again, the authors reported results on two other datasets. However, on neither of these datasets the ET-RR was compared with ET-RR (Concat). Therefore, I have concerns that the proposed framework may only be significant on the ARC dataset.\n\nMoreover, it will be interesting to see whether the essential term selector can be learned from distant supervision. For example, using REINFORCE to learn the selector model with the rewards from the end-task performance.

There is a large body of recent work that attempts to shed light on this puzzle, and each one tries to claim their share in the furthering of the understanding of the relationship between the geometry of the landscape and the dynamics that one chooses in optimization. The present paper is a fine addition to the literature with interesting observations and novel questions, however, it falls short in many core areas: An apparent work in progress that has a great potential. \n\nA major question (that I hope will easily be addressed) is on the definition of the barrier itself. According to the text, a barrier is defined judging by the minima of two 1-dimensional segments that connect weights connecting three consecutive steps: if the minimum of the line segment defined by the latter step is larger than the former, then it declared that a barrier is crossed. In a low dimensional world, this makes total sense, however, I fail to understand what kind of barrier it implies on the geometry of the landscape: Can the 1-dimensional lines be on the sides of a valley? Can one find *another* 1-dimensional projection for which the inequality is broken? How do such dependencies change the understanding of the problem? And if one is indeed only interested in the flat line segments (since SGD is making discrete steps), then one can, in principle, observe barrier crossing in a convex problem, as well? Is there an argument for otherwise? Or if it is a notion that applies equally well in a convex case then how should we really think about the barrier crossing? On the opposite point of view, can one not imagine a barrier crossing that doesn't appear in this triangular inequality above?\n\nThe paper is full of empirical evidence that is guided by a simple observable that is very intuitive, however, it lacks a comprehensive discussion on the new quantity they propose that I consider a major flaw, but that I think (hope) that the authors can fix very easily. Some minor points that would improve the readability and clarity for the reader:\n- The figures are not very reader-friendly, this can be improved by better using the whitespaces in the paper but it can also be improved by finding further observables that would summarize the observations instead of showing individual consecutive line interpolations.\n- What are the values of the y-axis in Figure 5 and 6? Are they the top eigenvalues of the Hessian?\n- In the models that are compared in Figure 7, what are their generalization properties (early stopping and otherwise)?\n- The interpretation at the end of p. 6 may be a good motivation for the reader if it had been introduced earlier for that section.\n\n\n4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "prompt": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

The authors present qualitative and quantitative observations to support their claims and propose new insights into the behavior of SGD. Overall, the paper is well-written and presents valuable contributions to the understanding of optimization dynamics in deep neural networks.\n\nOne strength of the paper is the thoroughness with which the authors investigate the behavior of SGD. They provide both qualitative visualizations and quantitative measures to support their claims. The inclusion of empirical evidence strengthens the reliability of their findings. The analysis of the alignment between mini-batch gradients and the sharp directions of the loss surface is particularly intriguing. The results show that larger batch sizes lead to increased alignment, indicating that SGD explores regions closer to the parameter initialization, potentially hindering its ability to find global optima.\n\nThe paper raises an important question regarding the impact of learning rate on convergence. The authors mention that in the quadratic setting, convergence depends on the learning rate relative to the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian. It would be interesting to further investigate the relationship between learning rate, batch size, and convergence behavior in deep network optimization. Does the increased alignment observed for larger batch sizes affect the optimal learning rate for convergence? Additionally, can this alignment be mitigated by adjusting other hyperparameters, such as weight decay or momentum?\n\nWhile the paper provides valuable insights, there are a few suggestions for improvement. First, the authors could provide further details on the datasets and architectures used in the experiments. This information would help readers to better understand the generalizability of the findings and the impact of specific choices on the observed dynamics. Second, the authors mention that the conclusions may differ depending on choices such as activation units and batch normalization. It would be beneficial to explore these differences and provide a more comprehensive analysis of how various choices affect the optimization dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, the paper does not explicitly discuss the potential limitations of the study. Since the observations are based on specific datasets and architectures, it is important to acknowledge the potential biases that may arise. Discussing the limitations would provide a more balanced perspective and encourage future research to address these limitations.\n\nIn terms of writing, the paper is generally clear and well-structured. The authors effectively present their arguments and provide sufficient context for the reader to follow along. However, there are some areas where the writing could be further improved. For example, there are a few instances where the authors use technical terms without clear definitions or explanations. Clarifying these terms would make the paper more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Exploring the Dynamics of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Deep Network Optimization\" offers valuable insights into the behavior of SGD in deep network optimization. The paper provides qualitative and quantitative evidence to support the authors' claims and proposes new perspectives on optimization dynamics. By addressing some suggestions and raising questions, future research can build upon these findings and further advance our understanding of SGD in deep learning optimization.", "source_documents": ["barriers, a more dominant way SGD performs exploration is by moving over them.\nThe same qualitative ...", "that the interpolation between consecutive iterations has a quadratic like shape and SGD moves over ...", "directions for larger batch sizes.

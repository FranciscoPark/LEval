This provision could potentially affect the transferability of the license, as it may be subject to interpretation and reformation by the court or tribunal.\n\nSection 14.12 states that if a party initiates legal action to enforce the terms of the agreement, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all reasonable costs of the action, including attorney's fees. This provision does not directly address the transferability of the license but could have implications for a party trying to transfer the license as it could result in increased legal costs.\n\nSection 14.16 specifically states that the provisions of the agreement are not intended to confer any rights of enforcement on any third party. This provision suggests that the license may not be transferable to a third party, as it explicitly states that the contract is personal to the parties and does not confer rights on third parties.\n\nAdditionally, Section 6.4 states that the rights and licenses granted to any Company-Skype Branded Customers will continue for a period of 24 months after termination or expiration of the agreement. This provision indicates that the license may have limitations on its transferability and may only be applicable to specific customers identified in the agreement.\n\nFinally, Section 14.4 addresses the assignment of the agreement and states that it may not be assigned to any other person without the written approval of the other parties. This provision suggests that the license may not be freely transferable and requires consent from the other parties to the agreement.\n\nIn summary, while the contract does not explicitly state whether the license is transferable or not, provisions such as Section 14.16, Section 6.4, and Section 14.4 suggest that there may be limitations on the ability to transfer the license to a third party. It is important to consult with a lawyer to fully review and understand the implications of these provisions in relation to the non-transferability of the license.", "source_documents": ["constituting any party the joint venturer, employee or partner of the other party or as conferring u...", "Party or its personnel, (iii) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without reliance in ...", "be removed.\n\n6.3.3 The termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not act as a waiver of any ...", "such party for the purposes of this Section 14.2.

These sections outline the insurance requirements and obligations of the parties involved in the agreement.\n\nOne of the relevant sections is Paragraph XV, which discusses the covenants of the party referred to as \"you\" in the agreement. It states that \"you\" must procure and maintain insurance coverage as required by the agreement. This indicates that there is a requirement for insurance that must be maintained by \"you\" for the benefit of the counterparty.\n\nFurthermore, section C under Paragraph XV provides specific details about the insurance coverage that must be obtained. It mentions various types of insurance, such as all risks coverage insurance, worker's compensation and employer's liability insurance, comprehensive general liability insurance, automobile liability insurance, liquor liability coverage, and any other insurance required by the terms of any lease or by \"us\" (the counterparty). This section also states that the required amounts of insurance coverage may be modified by \"us\" from time to time.\n\nAnother important section related to insurance is section D under Paragraph XV. It states that if \"you\" fail to procure and maintain the required insurance coverage, \"we\" (the counterparty) have the right and authority to immediately procure such insurance coverage and charge the expenses to \"you.\" This suggests that there are consequences for not meeting the insurance requirements.\n\nAdditionally, the Miscellaneous section, under subsection C, mentions that if legal action is taken to enforce the terms of the agreement and the counterparty prevails, they will be entitled to recover all litigation costs, including attorneys' fees. This further emphasizes the importance of complying with the insurance requirements.\n\nThe language used in these sections can be complex and may have legal implications, so it is essential to have a professional lawyer review them. A lawyer can help ensure that the insurance requirements are clear, reasonable, and appropriately protect the interests of both parties.

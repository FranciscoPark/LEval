My hubby got on Instagram to let our friends who'd already signed up for a pre-trip to book with us. We had a lot of requests because it's a great spot to meet families who wanted to stay together in a very nice spot in a beautiful city. One person who reached out said he was happy to wait until we got there to book because he wanted to see the hotel first.\n\nWe got there right before noon and we were met at the door by the front desk manager who shook my hand, gave me a brief hug and introduced himself so I knew that I was going to get a cool, professional approach. He told us there were only a few left and to ask for him if we needed anything and he smiled and said yes, we would need him. He said there were a few extra beds in the room where we'd be staying, but it was first come, first served, so we'd better come right back in if we wanted one and he pointed us in that direction.\n\nI'd decided that I wanted to see more of the city so I didn't ask for the room we were given, but after about 2 hours, I got one of those texts that said \"there is a room left\" and when I got there, it was the one I ended up with. And I got to tell the manager we had picked and he smiled and said, well, that's good to hear because he was getting a little nervous about not having anyone for it.\n\nAnother thing that was cool about staying at Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam was that we had a kitchenette, which I'd never had in a hotel before. I loved that and I told the manager what I thought about it and he said that's one of the things they like about the place too and he told me he was really proud of it. We were there because we'd bought an apartment, which was also a pretty cool deal.\n\nOn the first day of being in Amsterdam, we noticed that the coffee at The Grand just wasn't our thing. We took a pass. But after that, we went to our first coffee shop and the lady said she had heard a lot about that coffee and would have given it 5 stars, but she loved it. She gave me a little taste and we ended up ordering a bag there and when we got home, we got ourselves a small latte machine and started brewing our own coffee like nothing you have ever seen before. We loved it! And it was another perk of staying at Sofitel Legend The Grand Amsterdam.\n\nWe went to the RLD one day and we had to go up in a lift to get there, but that was cool too because the lift was really old and the walls were not new and there was a little section where you had to duck to get in, and it was really cool to be in it with all that history. The RLD was also really cool and I'd never been there before and it had a live jazz band and a cool bar downstairs and we tried the waffles.

The view of the harbor is better toward the right side. The construction is necessary so that city of Vancouver can prepare for the 2010 Winter Olympics. Yes, we definitely would stay here again!\n\nReview #42:\n\nOur hotel was not far from the harbor and we often walked down to Stanley Park to eat and enjoy the views. The hotel had a lovely roof top pool and we enjoyed the view from there. The concierge was very helpful in booking restaurants and getting door-to-door transportation. We would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others who enjoy the harbor views and the location to Stanley Park.\n\nReview #43:\n\nThe harbor view from the 20th floor was impressive and added to our enjoyment of our trip. The luxury spa on the ground floor was a lovely bonus. It was easy to get around on foot or by public transportation and we received great recommendations from the concierge for local restaurants. It was a quiet building, but there were many restaurants and shops nearby.\n\nReview #44:\n\nOur room was very comfortable and had a nice view of the harbor but we did not notice the construction blocking the view. They had a shuttle service to the airport and we found it very helpful. The staff went out of their way to help us and we enjoyed the complimentary wine and cheese in the lounge on the top floor.

OOD Detection: Majority of OOD detection methods rely on a reconstruction error and representation learning. (Ruff et al., 2018) trained a deep neural network to map data into a minimum volume hypersphere. Generative probabilistic novelty detection (GPND) (Pidhorskyi et al., 2018) employed the distance to the latent data manifold as the confidence measure and trained the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to model the manifold. Deep generative models are widely employed for latent space modeling in OOD detection (Zenati et al., 2018; Sabokrou et al., 2018). However, a recent paper by Nalisnick et al. (2019) discovered that popular deep generative models, such as variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma et al., 2014) or GLOW (Kingma et al., 2018), fail to detect simple OOD. While adversarially trained generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) or AAE, are not discussed in Nalisnick et al. (2019), our experiments with GPND show that such models can also struggle to detect such simple OODs.

They train a model f(x) to match the outputs of g_i(aug_i(x)), where g_i is a random network and aug_i is a particular type of augmentation. An example with high error in this task is treated as an out-of-distribution example. This work focuses on exploring blurring through SVD, where the smallest K singular values are set to 0, and K varies between different aug_i calls. They find that their method of consistently can achieve strong detection rates across multiple target-dataset pairs.\n\nComments:\n* The experimental results in this work are impressive, which introduces many more questions.\n* The model used for f and g is not mentioned in the text.\n* Figure 4 (left) suggests that the SVD-RND performs about the same between 10K and 50K examples. The level of robustness is surprising, but doesn\u2019t seem to square with intuition that more data ought to help. How little data can be used? In other words, extend the graph to the left. \n* The geometric transforms baseline is not fair, since SVD-RND uses multiple SVD transforms (b_train > 1) whereas the geometric transforms only have one. Please run a model with all the geometric transforms. This result is important for understanding whether the gains come from the particular transform (SVD) or the number of transforms used.\n* Following the spirit of the previous comment, what other data augmentations can be used in place of SVD? Typical image classification pipelines use a large variety of augmentations. I would suggest taking some augmentations from AutoAugment [1] and running RND on top of them.\n* An experiment that is missing is RND trained on blurred images. Is the blurring itself the important component, or is having multiple different heads important?\n* In general, I am confused about how a single head RND does not converge to 0 loss by learning the weights of g. This seems to be a simple optimization problem. The original RND paper avoided this problem by also using the network to learn a policy, but this does not exist in this approach.\n\nIn general, this work seems promising, but lacks proper ablations that elucidate what components of the method are important. I am happy to increase my score if the experiments suggests are added to the work.\n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

(2014), substantial progress has been done to improve the accuracy of supervised depth estimation from monocular images, including the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Li et al., 2015), joint optimization of surface normals (Qi et al., 2018), fusion of multiple depth maps (Lee et al., 2018), and ordinal classification (Fu et al., 2018). Consequently, as supervised techniques for depth estimation advanced rapidly, the availability of largescale depth labels became a bottleneck, especially for outdoor applications. Garg et al. (2016) and Godard et al. (2017) provided an alternative self-supervised strategy involving stereo cameras, where Spatial Transformer Networks (Jaderberg et al., 2015) can be used to geometrically warp, in a differentiable way, the right image into a synthesized left image, using the predicted depth from the left image. The photometric consistency loss between the resulting synthesized and original left images can then be minimized in an end-to-end manner using a Structural Similarity term (Wang et al., 2004) and additional depth regularization terms. Following Godard et al. (2017) and Ummenhofer et al. (2017), Zhou et al. (2017) generalized this to the purely monocular setting, where a depth and a pose networks are simultaneously learned from unlabeled monocular videos. Rapid progress in terms of architectures and objective functions (Yin & Shi, 2018; Mahjourian et al., 2018; Casser et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2018; Klodt & Vedaldi, 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018) have since then turned monocular depth estimation into one of the most successful applications of self-supervised learning, even outperforming supervised methods (Guizilini et al., 2019). The introduction of semantic information to improve depth estimates has been explored in prior works, and can be broadly divided into two categories. The first one uses semantic (or instance) information to mask out or properly model dynamic portions of the image, which are not accounted for in the photometric loss calculation.

The authors prove linear convergence rate if (1) the network dimensions are big enough so that the full product can have full rank, (2) the singular values of each weight matrices are approximately the same, (3) the initialized point is \u201cclose enough\u201d to the target.\n\nMy main concern about the study of GD on linear neural network is whether we really get any \u201cbenefit\u201d or \u201cacceleration\u201d from depth, i.e., is GD on linear neural nets any faster than GD on linear models. It\u2019s been shown that we get acceleration in some cases (e.g., $\\ell_p$ regression when $p>2$ [Arora et al. 18\u2019]), but some other results (e.g., [Shamir 18\u2019] mentioned in Section 5) show that GD on linear neural nets (when weight matrices are all scalar) suffer exponential (in depth) increase in convergence time at near zero region, due to the vanishing gradient phenomenon. From my understanding, this paper circumvents this problem by assuming deficiency margin, because in the setting of [Shamir 18\u2019], deficiency margin means that the initialized product ($W_{1:N}$) has the same sign as $\\Phi$ and far enough from zero, so we don\u2019t have to pass through the near-zero region.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll list specific concerns/questions/comments.\n* In my opinion, the statements about \u201cnecessity\u201d of two key assumptions are too strong, because the authors only provide counterexamples of non-convergence. As [Theorem 3, Shamir 18\u2019] shows (although in scalar case), even when the assumptions are not satisfied, a convergence rate $O(exp(N) * log(1/\\epsilon))$ is possible. It will be an interesting future work to clearly delineate the boundary between convergence and non-convergence.\n\n* In Thm 2 and Claim 3, what happens if dimension $d_0$ is smaller? What is the reason that you had to restrict it to high dimension? Is it due to high variance with few samples?\n\n* In Thm 2, constants $d\u2019_0$ and $a$ hide the dependence of the result on p, but I would suggest stating the dependence of those parameters on p, and also dependence on other parameters such as N.\n\n* In Section 5, there is a statement \u201cThis negative result, a theoretical manifestation of the \u201cvanishing gradient problem\u201d, is circumvented by balanced initialization.\u201d Can you elaborate more on that?

The authors analyze the convergence behavior of the algorithm and provide a convergence guarantee by showing that the objective value converges to a local minimum exponentially fast under certain conditions on the model size.\n\nThe algorithm they propose is based on the idea of using only the first eigenvectors of the end-to-end matrix as weight updates, while keeping the other eigenvectors fixed. This approach is able to achieve faster convergence compared to standard gradient descent. The authors also analyze the behavior of the algorithm under random initialization, and show that the guarantees given by their analysis continue to hold in that case.\n\nThe analysis of the algorithm is based on showing that the update direction of the algorithm is nearly aligned with the direction of steepest descent. The authors use this to prove that the algorithm converges exponentially fast to a local minimum. To establish this result, they also make certain assumptions on the eigenvalues of the end-to-end matrix, and on the random initializations.\n\nThe only requirements on the random initializations are that they have zero mean and are independent. This is a standard requirement in analysis of random functions. The eigenvalue assumptions made by the authors are standard in the analysis of deep neural networks. The main contribution of the paper is the analysis of the algorithm under random initializations. This is important because in practice, the initial weights are usually obtained through random sampling, which can make the convergence guarantees of standard gradient descent more difficult to verify.\n\nThe results of the paper are interesting and could be useful for understanding the behavior of deep linear neural networks. However, there are a few concerns that could be raised about the paper:\n\n1. The first eigenvectors of the end-to-end matrix are used as updates in the algorithm. This is interesting from a theoretical perspective, but it is unclear whether this approach is practical in practice. It may be difficult to differentiate between the first eigenvectors and other, more important eigenvectors when using just these few as updates. This could limit the effectiveness of the algorithm.\n2. The analysis of the algorithm requires several assumptions on the eigenvalues of the end-to-end matrix. While these assumptions are standard in the analysis of deep neural networks, it is unclear how well the results hold in practice, as the end-to-end matrix depends on the input and output dimensions of the network. It is possible that the assumptions hold for some networks but not for others.\n3. The convergence guarantee provided by the paper may be too optimistic. The results of the paper rely on assuming that the direction of steepest descent is well-aligned with the update direction of the algorithm. It is possible that this alignment does not hold in practice, and that the algorithm converges more slowly than predicted by the analysis.\n4. Finally, it is worth noting that the paper focuses on deep linear neural networks. While this is a fascinating area of research, there are many other types of neural networks that are studied more commonly, such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. It would be interesting to extend the analysis of the paper to these types of networks as well.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper provides a theoretical analysis of a training algorithm for deep linear neural networks.

Additionally, in Bayesian Compression the required bit-precision per layer is determined via the posterior variance. In contrast to our method, Bayesian Compression does not explicitly enforce clustering of weights during training and thus requires bit-widths in the range between 5 and 18 bits. Extending our method to include group-constraints for pruning is an interesting direction for future work. Another Bayesian method for simultaneous network quantization and pruning is soft weight-sharing (SWS) (Ullrich et al., 2017), which uses a Gaussian mixture model prior (and a KL term without trainable parameters such that the KL term reduces to the prior entropy). SWS acts like a probabilistic version of k-means clustering with the advantage of automatic collapse of unnecessary mixture components. Similar to learning the codebooks in our method, soft weight-sharing learns the prior from the data, a technique known as empirical Bayes. We cannot directly compare against soft weight-sharing since the authors do not report results on ternary networks. Gal et al. (2017) learn dropout rates by using a continuous relaxation of dropout\u2019s discrete masks (via the concrete distribution). The authors learn layer-wise dropout rates, which does not allow for dropout-rate-based pruning.

Learning and development Through the use of standard machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning, systems can learn to perform tasks and decision-making by trial and error. However, building effective machines that can adapt to complex and rapidly changing environments using these machines is a difficult task. One solution is to leverage expert human knowledge and create algorithms that can mimic human behavior.

One of the challenges in implementing reinforcement learning is the lack of clear visual feedback on the environment. To address this challenge, a new technique called Touchstream has been developed. Touchstream is a dynamic sensory stream that provides continuous auditory and visual feedback to the agent, allowing it to learn more efficiently and effectively.\n\n### Attention\nThe Touchstream allows for more precise and detailed environmental feedback, which leads to more efficient learning. The auditory and visual data provided by the Touchstream allows the agent to learn about the environment and make more informed decisions. The dynamic nature of the Touchstream also allows the agent to learn about changes in the environment more effectively. For these reasons, Touchstream is a promising tool for reinforcement learning.\n\n### System Components\nTouchstream is made up of three components: the audio mixer, the visual mixer, and the touch controller. The audio mixer takes in audio data from the environment and processes it to create the auditory signal that is sent to the touch controller. The visual mixer takes in visual data from the environment and processes it to create the visual signal that is sent to the touch controller. The touch controller takes in the auditory and visual signals and uses them to make decisions about how to interact with the environment.\n\n### Algorithm\nThe Touchstream algorithm trains the agent to predict the next action based on the current state of the environment. The agent is rewarded for making predictions that match the actual action taken by the environment, with the reward being scaled based on the precision and frequency of the predictions. The Touchstream provides a continuous stream of auditory and visual data that the agent uses to improve its predictions. The audio mixer and visual mixer are trained to create signals that are predictive of the next action, while the touch controller uses these signals to make decisions about how to interact with the environment.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Touchstream is a promising new tool for reinforcement learning. Its dynamic sensory stream provides more precise and detailed environmental feedback, allowing the agent to learn more efficiently and effectively. The touch controller allows the agent to interact with the environment in a more informed way, leading to faster and more efficient learning. Overall, the Touchstream is an innovative tool that could have a significant impact on the field of reinforcement learning.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

(2007) is the closest method we are aware of and we discuss it in detail as well as provide novel results in Appendix B, page 14. Another exciting recent work is perturbative variational inference (Bamler et al., 2017) which considers different objective functions for variational inference; we are not sure whether there exists a deeper relationship to debiasing schemes. There also exists a large body of work that uses the ELBO objective but considers ways to enlarge the variational family.

Non-linear but invertible transformations of reference densities have been used initially for density estimation in NICE (Dinh et al., 2014) and for variational inference in Hamiltonian variational inference (Salimans et al., 2015). Around the same time the general framework of normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) unified the previous works as some invertible continuous transformation of a distribution. Since then a large number of specialized flows with different computational requirements and flexibility have been constructed: inverse autoregressive flows (Kingma et al., 2016), masked autoregressive flows Papamakarios et al.

JVI is based on the generalized jackknife, a powerful method for reducing error in statistics. We show that JVI provides bias reduction for VAEs, leading to improved estimates of the marginal likelihood. We also show that higher-order bias reduction is more effective than lower-order bias reduction, and we provide examples of JVI estimators up to order five, which have less than 5000 sums of influence.\n\nKeywords: Variational autoencoder, generalized jackknife, jackknife variational inference, bias reduction, marginal likelihood, the jackknife.\n\nThe jackknife variational inference (JVI) method is a powerful technique for reducing bias in statistics. In this paper, we apply JVI to variational autoencoders (VAEs) to improve their performance.\n\nVAEs are a type of neural network designed to generate data that resembles a prior distribution over data points. They have been very successful in image generation, natural language processing, and other areas. However, VAEs can be biased due to the way they are trained, especially when the learning rate is high.\n\nJVI addresses this issue by computing a JVI estimator, which is a biased estimate of the true value. The JVI estimator is biased because it is based on the IWAE estimator, which itself is biased. However, as we show in this paper, the bias of the JVI estimator is reduced compared to the IWAE estimator.\n\nWe also show that higher-order bias reduction is more effective than lower-order bias reduction. This is because higher-order terms are more difficult to control, and even small errors can have a large impact on the final result.\n\nFinally, we provide examples of JVI estimators up to order five, which have less than 5000 sums of influence. These estimators are useful for training VAEs in practice, and we recommend using them when training VAEs with NUTS or MCMC.\n\nConclusion: The jackknife variational inference (JVI) method is a new way to reduce bias in variational autoencoders (VAEs).

For the binarized MNIST the authors show improved approximations given the same number of samples from the auxiliary distribution q(z|x).\n\nJVI seems to be an interesting extension of, and perspective on, the IWAE bound (and other Monte Carlo objectives). Some questions and comments:\n\n* The Cremer et al. (2017) paper contains some errors when interpreting the IWAE bound as a standard ELBO with a more flexible variational approximation distribution. For example eq. (1) in their paper does not correspond to an actual distribution, it is not properly normalized. This makes the connection in their section 2.1 unclear. I would suggest citing the following paper instead for this connection and the relation to importance sampling (IS):\nNaesseth, Linderman, Ranganath, Blei, \"Variational Sequential Monte Carlo\", 2017.\n\n* Regarding the analysis of the IWAE bound the paper by Rainforth et al. (2017) mentioned in the comments seems very relevant. Also, because of the strong connection between IWAE and IS detailed in the Naesseth et al. (2017) paper it is possible to make use of a standard Taylor approximation/delta methods to derive Prop. 1 and Prop. 2, see e.g. Robert & Casella, \"Monte Carlo Statistical Methods\" or Liu's \"Monte Carlo Strategies for Scientific Computing\".\n\n* It could be worth mentioning that the JVI objective function is now no longer (I think?) a lower bound to the log-evidence.\n\n* Could the surprising issue (IWAE-learned, JV1-evaluated being better than JV1-learned, JV1-evaluated) in Table 1 be because of different local optima?\n\n* Also, we can easily get unbiased estimates of the evidence p(x) using IS and optimize this objective wrt to model parameters. The proposal parameters can be optimized to minimize variance, how do you think this compares to the proposed method?\n\nMinor comments:\n* p(x) -> p_\\theta(x)\n* In the last paragraph of section 1 it seems like you claim that the expressiveness of p_\\theta(x|z) is a limitation of VAE.

Consider, for example, the trade-off between thermal resistance, electrical conductivity, and mechanical stability needed to design a nano-porous template with optimal thermoelectric efficiency. To that end, we leverage the posterior regularization framework and show that this constraint satisfaction problem can be formulated as sampling from a Gibbs distribution. The main challenges come from the black-box nature of those physical constraints, since they are obtained via solving highly non-linear PDEs. To overcome those difficulties, we introduce Surrogate-based Constrained Langevin dynamics for black-box sampling. We explore two surrogate approaches. The first approach exploits zero-order approximation of gradients in the Langevin Sampling and we refer to it as Zero-Order Langevin. In practice, this approach can be prohibitive since we still need to often query the expensive PDE solvers. The second approach approximates the gradients in the Langevin dynamics with deep neural networks, allowing us an efficient sampling strategy using the surrogate model. We prove the convergence of those two approaches when the target distribution is log-concave and smooth.

They consider the specific situation where the constraints are a solution of a complicated PDE solver and hence the derivatives or specific functional forms of the constraint cannot be obtained. They repose the problem as sampling from a Gibbs distribution whose potential contains constraints as penalties in a Lagrangian fashion. They now wish to sample from the Gibbs distribution using Langevin diffusion.  The Langevin process requires a derivative of the gradient.

The non error gradient part of this analysis has been established before and the authors mention the references appropriately. I have a couple of questions regarding the precise statements of the theorem that i will ask towards the end of the review. Overall its hard to comment on the tightness of the analysis as the non-error versions are also unclear of the tightness of the bounds. Nevertheless the bounds achieved do not look much worse than the non-error counterparts and are easy to implement. The rest of the bounds focus on achieving low error in approximation of the gradients in various settings.

This seems wrong particularly as the theorem as stated then allows eta to be set extremely small while K is finite, in which case there should be no convergence theorems at all. The condition on eta should be a theta(f (K)) for some f type of condition like in the second part of the theorem. I would suggest the authors to look into the theorem - or claify why this is the case. \n\nI am confused by the presentation of the Shi et al results as there is no penalty appearing for the approximation error due to an RKHS, only a finite sample penalty.

Sequential Monte Carlo (Liu & Chen, 1998) approximates the posterior by a set of particles. Assumed Density Filtering (ADF) (Maybeck, 1982) and Bayesian online learning (Opper, 1998) are deterministic posterior approximations based on moment matching. Other deterministic approaches are based on Laplace\u2019s approximation (MacKay, 1992): Kirkpatrick et al. (2017) use multiple diagonal Gaussian posterior approximations of previous time-steps to regularise future tasks; Ritter et al. (2018) use a single (block-diagonal) posterior approximation, summarising all previous time-steps. The latter method is closer to Bayesian online inference, as it is an approximation of Eq. (1). Our work is based on online VB (Opper, 1998; Ghahramani, 2000; Sato, 2001; Broderick et al., 2013), which approximates the posterior at every time-step by minimising the KL-divergence between a parametric (here Gaussian) and the true posterior distribution. In contrast to online VB, we approximate the posterior by a Gaussian distribution and a running memory. Other approaches are based on various types of episodic memory, motivated by their empirical success in preventing catastrophic forgetting. The basic idea of rehearsal (Ratcliff, 1990) is to train on both the new data and a subset of previous data or pseudo samples (Robins, 1995; Shin et al., 2017; Kemker & Kanan, 2017) sampled from a generative model. The memory-based online inference methods most similar to our approach are VCL (Nguyen et al., 2018) and VVM (Minka et al., 2009). Both methods use a Gaussian distribution and a running memory to approximate the posterior. VCL uses heuristics such as random selection or the k-center method to update the memory.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

This is due to the increasing availability of large amounts of data, which can be easily and efficiently processed. However, the problem arises when the underlying distribution changes over time, which is referred to as non-stationary data.\n\nOne popular approach for handling non-stationary data is to perform incremental learning, where the model is updated incrementally to adapt to changes in the data distribution. One such approach is Bayesian online inference, where the posterior distribution of the model is updated incrementally using a Gaussian process. This method is computationally efficient and can handle non-stationary data.\n\nOn the other hand, many existing online learning algorithms suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which can occur when the model forgets previous knowledge and focuses only on learning new knowledge. To address this issue, several methods have been proposed, such as replay, transfer learning, and forgetting gates. However, these methods are either computationally expensive or require additional assumptions.\n\nIn contrast, the proposed method uses a combination of running memory and Gaussian approximation to overcome catastrophic forgetting. The running memory is a small subset of the entire data and is updated dynamically to reflect recent changes in the data distribution. The Gaussian approximation provides a tractable approximation of the posterior distribution, which can be used for computationally efficient online learning.\n\nOverall, the proposed method is a novel approach to address catastrophic forgetting in online learning, which is shown to be effective in handling non-stationary data. Comparison with existing methods has shown that the method is computationally efficient and can handle large amounts of data.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Summary:\nThis proposes considers neural networks training with non-stationary streaming data. To address online inference, the paper uses variational online updates and a running memory (coreset) summarising the data points seen so far, as recently used in the variational continual learning approach. First, the paper identifies a gap in this recent approach that coreset point selection process does not take into account the approximation quality. The paper develops a sound procedure to select the memory points, essentially to identify \u201cdifficult\u201d data points under the current posterior and put them into the running memory. Second, to handle \u201cconcept drift\u201d, the paper considers imposing some decaying on the likelihood of past data and derives post-hoc variational posterior updates for this case. Two contributions are validated on some streaming regression and classification tasks.\n\n2. Opinion and rationales\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards \u201caccept\u201d for this paper since it presents two interesting contributions (albeit of incremental novelty)  to the approximate inference area, it has clear execution and super clean presentation, and the experiments clearly demonstrate the values of the proposed approaches.\n\nI would like the paper to clarify the following:\n\na. I find the objective for selecting memory points interesting, but am wondering if using individual predictability terms by themselves are good enough to select these points. Perhaps, after some thoughts, memory is perhaps not the right word to characterise these points. \n\nIt seems to me (i) these terms indicate how well the current posterior predicts the data points and thus this objective will tend to favour points with low predictive likelihood to be selected. That is, these points are important when *all other points* are presented, (ii) there will be *no diversity* in the memory as illustrated in the 2d classification example.\n\nThis means the points selected here have quite different characteristics compared to coreset points or the full dataset in general. Coreset points ideally can compactly represent the full dataset and can be used for inference in place of the full dataset.\n\nThat said, the contribution presented here is very useful. Just that I\u2019m not sure how well this will work in more challenging continual learning set-up where diversity is important for a long sequence of diverse tasks.\n\nb. The paper presents a post-hoc modification to approximate posterior (\u2018s mean and variance) to account for the decay in the likelihood contribution from past data. I wonder if this post-hoc adjustment is identical to running approximate inference with the adjusted likelihood?\n\nc. the adaptation parameters need to be tuned/known in advance, which seems to be a disadvantage of the current approach. Is the update presented here somewhat robust to mis-specification of these parameters? How would these be tuned in a more practical setting in which data arrive sequentially and we might not know the underlying \u201cconcept\u201d.\n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

(Vasilescu & Terzopoulos, 2002), in their framework of TensorFaces, proposed to treat facial image data as multidimensional arrays and analyze them with tensor decompositions, which led to significant boost in face recognition accuracy. (Bailey & Aeron, 2017) employed higher-order co-occurence data and tensor factorization techniques to improve on word embeddings models. Tensor methods also allow to produce more accurate and robust recommender systems by taking into account a multifaceted nature of real environments (Frolov & Oseledets, 2017). In recent years a great deal of work was done in applications of tensor calculus to both theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning algorithms. (Lebedev et al., 2015) represented filters in a convolutional network with CP decomposition (Harshman, 1970; Carroll & Chang, 1970) which allowed for much faster inference at the cost of a negligible drop in performance. (Novikov et al., 2015) proposed to use Tensor Train (TT) decomposition (Oseledets, 2011) to compress fully\u2013connected layers of large neural networks while preserving their expressive power. Later on, TT was exploited to reduce the number of parameters and improve the performance of recurrent networks in long\u2013term forecasting (Yu et al., 2017) and video classification (Yang et al., 2017) problems. In addition to the practical benefits, tensor decompositions were used to analyze theoretical aspects of deep neural nets. (Cohen et al., 2016) investigated a connection between various network architectures and tensor decompositions, which made possible to compare their expressive power. Specifically, it was shown that CP and Hierarchial Tucker (Grasedyck, 2010) decompositions correspond to shallow networks and convolutional networks respectively. Recently, this analysis was extended by (Khrulkov et al., 2018) who showed that TT decomposition can be represented as a recurrent network with multiplicative connections. This specific form of RNNs was also empirically proved to provide a substantial performance boost over standard RNN models (Wu et al., 2016). First results on the connection between tensor decompositions and neural networks were obtained for rather simple architectures, however, later on, they were extended in order to analyze more practical deep neural nets. It was shown that theoretical results can be generalized to a large class of CNNs with ReLU nonlinearities (Cohen & Shashua, 2016) and dilated convolutions (Cohen et al., 2018), providing valuable insights on how they can be improved.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

In their pioneering study, (Cohen et al., 2016) analyzed a class of tensor-based models called tensor train (Tensor Train, TT) decompositions, highlighting the possibility of expressing many complex functions using these building blocks.

(2019) in Table 1. It can be seen from the table that our method has better robustness radius.\n\n1. Motivation\n\nThe robustness of deep neural networks is studied extensively in recent years. However, existing methods either have limited robustness guarantees or require expensive computation. To address these issues, randomized smoothing was introduced in the last decade. The main idea is to add small perturbations to the input data, and the resulting model output will be insensitive to these perturbations. In this work, we investigate the robustness certification for a general non-isotropic Gaussian noise case with unknown covariance.\n\n1. Related Work\n\nRandomized smoothing has shown promising results in improving robustness. In a previous work, Cohen et al. (2019) and Lecuyer et al. (2019) have studied the certification of robustness for isotropic Gaussian noise case. In this work, we generalize the previous method to a more general non-isotropic Gaussian noise case. In addition, we find that the bound in Theorem 1 is tighter than the previous method in the Gaussian noise case. We also show that the bound is tight for the binary case.\n\n1. Contributions\n\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n\n* We provide a tight bound for L2 perturbation of isotropic Laplace distribution with the maximum deviation less than \u00bd.\n* We show that for the binary case, the bound in Theorem 1 is tight, which means the maximum deviation will exceed \u00bd in some cases.\n* We extend the previous method to a non-isotropic Gaussian noise case.\n* We show that the bound in our method is tighter than the previous method in isotropic Gaussian noise case.\n* We give a rigorous proof for the tightness of the bound for binary case.\n\n1. Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, we have proposed a new method to certify robustness of deep neural networks. The proposed method has tighter bounds than the previous method in isotropic Gaussian noise case, and the tightness of the bound is guaranteed. We also show that the method works for binary case with a tight bound. Our method is a simple and efficient way to improve the robustness of deep neural networks.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

For example, Feynman-Kac Formalism can be used to improve robustness (Wang et al., 2018). In this paper, we focus on the classification setting, where the goal is to provide guarantee of a constant prediction among a small region specified via some metric. The robustness certificate can be either exact or conservative, so long as a constant prediction is guaranteed in the certified region. Note that the certification of a completely black-box model requires checking the prediction values at every point around the point of interest, which is clearly infeasible. A practical certification algorithm inevitably has to specify and leverage the functional structure of the classifier in use to reduce the required computation. Exact certificates. The exact certificate of deep networks is typically derived for the networks with a piecewise linear activation function such as ReLU. Such networks have an equivalent mixed integer linear representation (Cheng et al., 2017; Lomuscio & Maganti, 2017; Dutta et al., 2017; Bunel et al., 2018). Hence, one may apply mixed integer linear programming to find the worst case adversary within any convex polyhedron such as an `1-ball or `\u221e-ball. Despite the elegant solution, the complexity is, in general, NP-hard and the algorithms are not scalable to large problems(Tjeng et al., 2017). Conservative certificates. A conservative certificate can be more scalable than the exact methods, since one can trade-off the accuracy of certification with efficiency (Gouk et al., 2018; Tsuzuku et al., 2018; Cisse et al., 2017; Anil et al., 2018; Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017). For example, one can relax the search of the worst case adversary as a simpler optimization problem that only bounds the effect of such adversary. Alternatively, people also consider the robustness problem in a modular way, where the robustness guarantee can be derived iteratively for each layer in the deep networks by considering the feasible values for each hidden layer (Gowal et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018).", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

Some recent studies have developed more complicated regularization approaches to continuous control tasks. Cheng et al. (2019) regularizes the stochastic action distribution \u03c0(a|s) using a suboptimal control prior. The regularization weight at a given state is adjusted based on the temporal difference (TD) error. The larger the TD error, the more the action distribution moves towards the prior. Galashov et al. (2019) introduces a default policy that receives limited information as a regularizer. The information asymmetry between the behavior policy and the default policy helps to accelerate convergence and improve performance. Parisi et al. (2019) introduces TD error regularization to penalize inaccurate value estimation and Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Schulman et al., 2016) regularization to penalize GAE variance. However, most of these regularizations are rather complicated (Galashov et al., 2019), specifically designed for certain algorithms (Parisi et al., 2019), or need prior information (Cheng et al., 2019).

The major difference between R-Transformer and the original Transformer is the replacement of positional embedding with an RNN layer, but (in my opinion) the authors did not demonstrate sufficiently its effectiveness via ablative studies (see below). Moreover, some prior works have already exploited the locality structure in Transformers.

I think the authors should instead control the # of model parameters, especially since you are running only on small tasks with small-sized models.\n    ii) It is nice that the authors tested R-Transformer on a variety of tasks--- this is important. However, in no way do these number achieve the levels of the \"state-of-the-art\", which the authors claim at the end of Section 1 (e.g., [2] has better number on seqMNIST and character-level PTB, and the Transformer-XL actually achieves <55 perplexity on word-level PTB).

When comparing the R-Transformer to a combination of RNN and Transformer, it would be interesting to perform a detailed analysis on the trade-off between the RNN and Transformer components.\n3. The paper applies a simple RNN as the local structure learning component. There are several other RNN variants that might provide better results. Future work could explore the use of other RNN variants for better performance in sequence learning tasks.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed R-Transformer model offers a promising way to model sequential data in various domains, specifically for tasks that exhibit complex local structures. The authors demonstrated its superiority over popular machine learning models like TCN and standard Transformer. The study's results emphasize the importance of addressing issues with vanishing and exploding gradients, capturing local information, and incorporating sequential information in the RNN context.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The problem of covariate shift was already observed, as the author notes: \u201cthe network must not solely be shown examples of accurate driving, but also how to recover once a mistake has been made\u201d. This issue was formalized in the work of (Ross & Bagnell, 2010), who on one hand proved an O( T 2) regret bound, and on the other hand provided an example showing this bound is tight. The subsequent work (Ross et al., 2011) proposed the DAGGER algorithm which obtains linear regret, provided the agent can both interact with the environment, and query the expert policy. Our approach also requires environment interaction, but importantly does not need to query the expert. note is the work of (Venkatraman et al., 2015), which extended DAGGER to time series prediction problems by using the true targets as expert corrections. Imitation learning has been used within the context of modern RL to help improve sample efficiency (Chang et al., 2015; Ross & Bagnell, 2014; Sun et al., 2017; Hester et al., 2018; Le et al., 2018; Cheng & Boots, 2018) or overcome exploration (Nair et al., 2017). These settings assume the reward is known and that the policies can then be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. In this case, covariate shift is less of an issue since it can be corrected using the reinforcement signal. The work of (Luo et al., 2019) also proposed a method to address the covariate shift problem when learning from demonstrations when the reward is known, by conservatively extrapolating the value function outside the training distribution using negative sampling. This addresses a different setting from ours, and requires generating plausible states which are off the manifold of training data, which may be challenging when the states are high dimensional such as images. The work of (Reddy et al., 2019) proposed to treat imitation learning within the Q-learning framework, setting a positive reward for all transitions inside the demonstration data and zero reward for all other transitions in the replay buffer. This rewards the agent for repeating (or returning to) the expert\u2019s transitions.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

In addition to its usefulness, there is a significant amount of research in the field of imitation learning, which has driven the development of various algorithms that can learn to perform tasks from expert demonstrations.\n\nIn this section, we'll delve into some of the popular imitation learning approaches, and examine their strengths and weaknesses, as well as the techniques used to overcome their shortcomings. First off, we'll discuss supervised imitation learning (SI), which is a fairly straightforward approach where the agent learns to imitate the expert behavior by directly predicting the actions from expert demonstrations. While this approach is simple and fairly straightforward, it is often the case that more complex tasks can be difficult to model using supervised learning.\n\nTo tackle this problem, several imitation learning techniques have been proposed, including Deep behavioral cloning (DBC) and Distributionally Robust Behavioral Cloning (DRBC), which are highly effective at learning complex tasks that can't be modeled using supervised learning alone. These techniques work by taking into account the uncertainty of the expert demonstrations, which helps to improve the generalization performance of the learned policies.\n\nAnother popular imitation learning approach is unsupervised imitation learning (UIL), which works by training an agent to learn from scratch by generating an initial policy that is capable of modeling the underlying task structure. UIL can be effective when the expert demonstrations are noisy or not well-structured, or when there is not enough data to learn a good representation of the task space.\n\nTo further enhance the performance of imitation learning algorithms, various techniques have been proposed to deal with the challenges of limited demonstration data and uncertainty in expert demonstrations. For example, Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Model-Agnostic Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) are two approaches that can help to improve imitation learning by inferring the expert's true reward function and task objectives.\n\nIn conclusion, imitation learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to scale up learning and deployment in various domains. The plethora of approaches, techniques, and challenges in the field have spurred research and development of new methods and algorithms, each one aiming to tackle specific limitations and weaknesses, to create more effective and robust imitation learning systems. As imitation learning continues to evolve, it is clear that it will play a vital role in shaping the future of autonomous systems.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The method performs well empirically and has a theoretical support (although only for a tabular setting). While there are some issues (see below), this is a good paper. I vote for acceptance.  \n\n* Major comments and questions:\n- Accuracy of posterior approximation via ensemble. \nIt is unclear whether the posterior approximated from ensemble is accurate. More specifically, these ensemble policies are trained using BC loss. Under a limited amount of data (where BC fails), these policies would also fail and are inaccurate. Therefore, it should not be expected that a posterior from these inaccurate policies is accurate. Have the authors measure or analyze accuracy of these policies or that of the posterior? This important point is not mentioned or analyzed in the paper.\n\n- Alternative approaches to posterior approximation and uncertainty computation. \nThere are other approaches to obtain a posterior besides the ensemble approach, e.g., Bayesian neural networks. Such alternatives were not mentioned in the paper. Also, there are other quantities for measuring uncertainty besides the variance such as the entropy. These approaches and quantities have different pros and cons and they should be discussed in the paper.\n\n- Sample complexity in terms of environment interactions. \nThe sample complexity in terms of environment interactions is an important criterion for IL. I suggest the authors to include this criterion in the experiments. \n\n* Minor questions:\n- Why does the minibatch size is only 4 in the experiments for all methods. This is clearly too small for a reasonable training of deep networks. Is this a typo?\n\n- It is strange to not evaluate GAIL in the continuous control experiments, since GAIL was originally evaluated in these domains.

In this work, the authors present a novel method for solving the imitation learning problem in the setting where the expert has hidden states and the environment and the agent's behavior is noisy. The method employs a diversity cost function that penalizes the distance between the learned policy and the expert policy in terms of the input distribution density.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions.

However, GuessWhat is relatively an easy task because it only allows the answer form of yes or no. The baseline visual question answering (VQA) model achieves 78.5%.

The authors of \u201cActive Inference for Task-Oriented Dialogue\u201d (Grzeszczuk et al., 2016) propose an active inference framework that uses a model of the user\u2019s mental state to generate questions that contribute to the goal of the dialogue.\n\nAnother approach is multi-task learning, where the system is trained to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. The goal is to learn shared knowledge and representations that can be used for different tasks, which can improve the overall performance of the system. The authors of \u201cMulti-Task Learning for Intent Classification and Slot Filling in Task-Oriented Dialog\u201d (Kumar et al., 2016) propose a multi-task learning approach that classifies intents and fills slots using a single model that is trained on a large dataset of task-oriented dialogues.\n\nReinforcement learning is another popular approach for task-oriented dialog. The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected reward over a series of interactions between the system and user. The authors of \u201cLearning Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems by Reinforcement Learning\u201d (Jiang et al., 2016) propose a hybrid RL approach that uses a model-based exploration policy to identify a good set of actions and a policy-based exploration policy to explore the action space.\n\nSummary:\n\n* The related work section should describe the existing literature on task-oriented visual dialog, with a focus on the different approaches that have been proposed. The proposed AQM+ algorithm is a new method that is an extension of the AQM framework and is aimed at improving the performance of task-oriented dialog systems.\n* The section should provide an overview of the key concepts and methodologies used in the proposed AQM+ algorithm, including the question-asking process and the information gain calculation used to evaluate the usefulness of a question.\n* The section should compare and contrast the proposed AQM+ algorithm to other existing algorithms in the field, such as the Qbot framework and the RL algorithms used in the original AQM algorithm. This should include a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed", "evaluation": "rouge"}
{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "The paper proposes an improvement over the AQM approach for an information-theoretic framework for task-oriented dialog systems. Specifically, the paper tries to circumvent the problem of explicitly calculating the information gain while asking a question in the AQM setting. While the original AQM approach sweeps over all possible guesses and answers while estimating information gain, this is rendered impractical in scenarios where this space cannot be tractably enumerated. As a solution, AQM+ proposes sweeping over only some top-k relevant instantiations of answers and guesses in this space by normalizing the probabilities of the subset of the space in consideration. \n\nComments:\n- The paper is overloaded with notations and the writing is not very smooth. The terse nature of the content makes it hard to follow in general. If someone apriori was not familiar with task-oriented dialog or the visual dialog setting in Das et al. (2017b), it would be quite hard to follow.\n- While mentioning SL/RL approaches while comparing or introducing the setup, the authors do not make any distinction between discriminative and generative dialog models. Specifically, SL approaches could either be trained discriminatively to rank options among the provided ones given dialog context or in a generative manner via token-level teacher forcing. The authors should clearly make this distinction in the introduction and in other places where it\u2019s needed.\n- The authors should stress more upon the approximations involved while calculating mutual information. As far as I understand, even in the AQM approach the numerator and the denominator within the logarithm are estimated from a different set of parameters and as such they need not be consistent with each other under marginalization. The term resembles MI and ensuring consistency in such a framework would require either of the numerator or the denominator to be close to something like a variational approximation of the true distribution. In addition, AQM+ adopts the same framework as AQM but computes MI over some top-k of the random variables being considered. Could the authors comment more on why restricting the space of r.v.\u2019s to some top-k samples is a good idea? Would that not lead to somewhat of a biased estimator?\n- Unless I am missing something, training aprxAgen from the training data (indA) seems odd. Assuming, this to be Qbot\u2019s mental model of Abot -- there is no prior reason why this should be initialized or trained in such a manner. Similarly, the training paradigm of the depA setting is confusing. If they are trained in a manner similar to a regular Abot -- either SL or RL -- then they\u2019re not approximate mental models but are rather just another Abot agent in play which is being queried by\n\n6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

For instance, the observed reward channel is often subject to noise in practice (e.g., when observed rewards are collected through sensors), and thus observed rewards may not be credible. Also, in applications such as robotics, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm can be manipulated to produce arbitrary errors. In this paper, we consider noisy RL problems where observed rewards by RL agents are generated with a reward confusion matrix. We call such observed rewards as perturbed rewards. We develop an unbiased reward estimator aided robust RL framework that enables RL agents to learn in noisy environments while observing only perturbed rewards. Our framework draws upon approaches for supervised learning with noisy data. The core ideas of our solution include estimating a reward confusion matrix and defining a set of unbiased surrogate rewards. We prove the convergence and sample complexity of our approach. Extensive experiments on different DRL platforms show that policies based on our estimated surrogate reward can achieve higher expected rewards, and converge faster than existing baselines.

Their proposed method is unbiased, as long as the number of samples used to estimate the rewards is sufficiently large.

In practice, RL is often faced with the challenge of noisy reward signals. In this paper, we study the problem of learning in scenarios where the rewards are multidimensional and correlated. One way to address this challenge is to use supervised learning algorithms, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL). These algorithms are trained using samples from the reinforcement learning problem and use them to learn a policy that minimizes the difference between the true reward function and the estimated one. However, the estimated reward function is often noisy and may not accurately reflect the true reward. This can lead to inaccurate policies and poor performance in the long run. In this paper, we propose a new method for learning in noisy reward environments using deep reinforcement learning.

Recent studies (Huang et al., 2017; Kos & Song, 2017; Lin et al., 2017) show that learned RL policies can be easily misled with small perturbations in observations. The presence of noise is very common in real-world environments, especially in robotics-relevant applications. Consequently, robust (adversarial) reinforcement learning (RRL/RARL) algorithms have been widely studied, aiming to train a robust policy which is capable of withstanding perturbed observations (Teh et al., 2017; Pinto et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2018) or transferring to unseen environments (Rajeswaran et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2017). However, these robust RL algorithms mainly focus on noisy vision observations, instead of the observed rewards. A couple of recent works (Lim et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2017) have also looked into a rather parallel question of training robust RL algorithms with uncertainty in models. Learning with Noisy Data Learning appropriately with biased data has received quite a bit of attention in recent machine learning studies Natarajan et al. (2013); Scott et al.

With the widespread use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, various models and frameworks have been developed for this task. However, many existing QA systems rely on structured knowledge bases and are less effective when dealing with questions that lack clear, definitive answers. In this work, we aim to address this limitation by proposing an essential term aware retriever-reader model (ET-RR) for open-domain QA. Our model improves upon existing approaches by effectively identifying essential terms in a question and formulating more efficient queries for retrieving relevant evidence, leading to better QA performance.\n\nMethodology:\n\nOur proposed ET-RR model comprises two stages: an essential term selector (ET-Net) and an attention-enhanced reader (AT-Reader). The ET-Net is responsible for identifying essential terms in a question, while the AT-Reader takes as input a tuple of question, answer choice, and retrieved passage and uses multiple layers of attention to make predictions.\n\nThe ET-Net is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) with bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, followed by a fully connected layer. During training, the loss is calculated based on cross-entropy between the predicted probabilities and the actual labels. In addition, we compare the performance of different attention mechanisms and the impact of varying the number of essential terms used for selecting passages.\n\nExperimental Results:\n\nOur proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches on the three datasets used for evaluation: ARC, RACE-Open, and MCScript-Open. The results indicate the importance of considering essential terms in a question when constructing the query for retrieval, as well as the effectiveness of multi-stage attention mechanisms in the reader component. These findings suggest that our ET-RR model provides a step forward in our understanding of how to address open-domain QA tasks effectively.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn this work, we proposed a novel essential term aware retriever-reader model for open-domain QA. Our approach extends existing methods by introducing an essential term selector component and enhancing the reader component using attention mechanisms. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of addressing essential terms in a question for more accurate QA performance. With the growing interest in AI education, the impact of our research can be substantial, as it improves the learning experience and outcomes for students and instructors alike.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The above two proposed modules (reader and selector) are not very novel, but are still valid contributions to me. Experiments on the ARC dataset shows that (1) the proposed reader itself improves over the state-of-the-art on the leaderboard; (2) introducing the essential term selector further improves the above results by about 2%.\n\nAlthough the paper also provides additional experiments on other datasets, I feel that the contributions of the proposed methods are not sufficiently verified. I would suggest the authors consider the following further experiments that I believe could improve its ratings:\n\n(1) The proposed reader works very well on ARC. However, besides the BiDAF, there is no comparison between the proposed reader and previous models on datasets other than ARC. In order to know whether the result generalizes or not, I think the authors should conduct experiments on the regular RACE or other multi-choice QA datasets, to fully test the reader model.\n\n(2) It is not clear whether the essential term selector could help on datasets other than science questions. Again, the authors reported results on two other datasets. However, on neither of these datasets the ET-RR was compared with ET-RR (Concat). Therefore, I have concerns that the proposed framework may only be significant on the ARC dataset.\n\nMoreover, it will be interesting to see whether the essential term selector can be learned from distant supervision. For example, using REINFORCE to learn the selector model with the rewards from the end-task performance.

What is the accuracy drop we should allow to pay for reduction in number of parameters or FLOPs?\n5. For the evaluation, I would suggest to show that the learned policy is better than a random one: e. g. not using the controller to define policy (in line 20 of the algorithm) and using a random random policy instead.\n6.

The proposed method is evaluated on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, achieving significant compression rates and comparable accuracy.\nAccording to the paper, DenseNet-based models are effective at achieving high accuracy on various computer vision tasks, but they require high computational resources.

They achieve significant compression rates and comparable accuracy while maintaining the DenseNet architecture.\nThe proposed method combines reinforcement learning with a LSTM controller and pruning techniques to select the most efficient neural network architecture. The authors achieve this by identifying the most important connections in each layer and then layer-wise pruning them. The result is a compact and efficient network that performs well on both CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.\nThe authors perform experiments on both standard DenseNet and their proposed layer-wise pruning method (LWP).

{"query": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper.", "gt": "The non-convex nature of the loss landscape of deep neural networks (DNN) lends them the intuition that over the course of training, stochastic optimization algorithms explore different regions of the loss surface by entering and escaping many local minima due to the noise induced by mini-batches. But is this really the case? This question couples the geometry of the DNN loss landscape with how stochastic optimization algorithms like SGD interact with it during training. Answering this question may help us qualitatively understand the dynamics of deep neural network optimization. We show evidence through qualitative and quantitative experiments that mini-batch SGD rarely crosses barriers during DNN optimization. As we show, the mini-batch induced noise helps SGD explore different regions of the loss surface using a seemingly different mechanism. To complement this finding, we also investigate the qualitative reason behind the slowing down of this exploration when using larger batch-sizes. We show this happens because gradients from larger batch-sizes align more with the top eigenvectors of the Hessian, which makes SGD oscillate in the proximity of the parameter initialization, thus preventing exploration.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "The subject of how a given algorithm explores the landscape is still a poorly understood area in training neural networks. There is a large body of recent work that attempts to shed light on this puzzle, and each one tries to claim their share in the furthering of the understanding of the relationship between the geometry of the landscape and the dynamics that one chooses in optimization. The present paper is a fine addition to the literature with interesting observations and novel questions, however, it falls short in many core areas: An apparent work in progress that has a great potential. \n\nA major question (that I hope will easily be addressed) is on the definition of the barrier itself. According to the text, a barrier is defined judging by the minima of two 1-dimensional segments that connect weights connecting three consecutive steps: if the minimum of the line segment defined by the latter step is larger than the former, then it declared that a barrier is crossed. In a low dimensional world, this makes total sense, however, I fail to understand what kind of barrier it implies on the geometry of the landscape: Can the 1-dimensional lines be on the sides of a valley? Can one find *another* 1-dimensional projection for which the inequality is broken? How do such dependencies change the understanding of the problem? And if one is indeed only interested in the flat line segments (since SGD is making discrete steps), then one can, in principle, observe barrier crossing in a convex problem, as well? Is there an argument for otherwise? Or if it is a notion that applies equally well in a convex case then how should we really think about the barrier crossing? On the opposite point of view, can one not imagine a barrier crossing that doesn't appear in this triangular inequality above?\n\nThe paper is full of empirical evidence that is guided by a simple observable that is very intuitive, however, it lacks a comprehensive discussion on the new quantity they propose that I consider a major flaw, but that I think (hope) that the authors can fix very easily. Some minor points that would improve the readability and clarity for the reader:\n- The figures are not very reader-friendly, this can be improved by better using the whitespaces in the paper but it can also be improved by finding further observables that would summarize the observations instead of showing individual consecutive line interpolations.\n- What are the values of the y-axis in Figure 5 and 6? Are they the top eigenvalues of the Hessian?\n- In the models that are compared in Figure 7, what are their generalization properties (early stopping and otherwise)?\n- The interpretation at the end of p. 6 may be a good motivation for the reader if it had been introduced earlier for that section.\n\n\n4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

They also show that when the batch size is increased, the gradients become more aligned with the top eigenvectors of the Hessian for larger batch sizes, reducing the degree of oscillation and speeding up exploration.\n\nThese findings provide a new angle of view on the behavior of SGD, complementing the traditional diffusion perspective by highlighting the role of oscillation in exploration and the importance of alignment between gradients and the high curvature directions for efficient exploration.

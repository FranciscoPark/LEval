They train a model f(x) to match the outputs of g_i(aug_i(x)), where g_i is a random network and aug_i is a particular type of augmentation. An example with high error in this task is treated as an out-of-distribution example. This work focuses on exploring blurring through SVD, where the smallest K singular values are set to 0, and K varies between different aug_i calls. They find that their method of consistently can achieve strong detection rates across multiple target-dataset pairs.\n\nComments:\n* The experimental results in this work are impressive, which introduces many more questions.\n* The model used for f and g is not mentioned in the text.\n* Figure 4 (left) suggests that the SVD-RND performs about the same between 10K and 50K examples. The level of robustness is surprising, but doesn\u2019t seem to square with intuition that more data ought to help. How little data can be used? In other words, extend the graph to the left. \n* The geometric transforms baseline is not fair, since SVD-RND uses multiple SVD transforms (b_train > 1) whereas the geometric transforms only have one. Please run a model with all the geometric transforms. This result is important for understanding whether the gains come from the particular transform (SVD) or the number of transforms used.\n* Following the spirit of the previous comment, what other data augmentations can be used in place of SVD? Typical image classification pipelines use a large variety of augmentations. I would suggest taking some augmentations from AutoAugment [1] and running RND on top of them.\n* An experiment that is missing is RND trained on blurred images. Is the blurring itself the important component, or is having multiple different heads important?\n* In general, I am confused about how a single head RND does not converge to 0 loss by learning the weights of g. This seems to be a simple optimization problem. The original RND paper avoided this problem by also using the network to learn a policy, but this does not exist in this approach.\n\nIn general, this work seems promising, but lacks proper ablations that elucidate what components of the method are important.

Consequently, as supervised techniques for depth estimation advanced rapidly, the availability of largescale depth labels became a bottleneck, especially for outdoor applications. Garg et al. (2016) and Godard et al. (2017) provided an alternative self-supervised strategy involving stereo cameras, where Spatial Transformer Networks (Jaderberg et al., 2015) can be used to geometrically warp, in a differentiable way, the right image into a synthesized left image, using the predicted depth from the left image. The photometric consistency loss between the resulting synthesized and original left images can then be minimized in an end-to-end manner using a Structural Similarity term (Wang et al., 2004) and additional depth regularization terms. Following Godard et al. (2017) and Ummenhofer et al. (2017), Zhou et al. (2017) generalized this to the purely monocular setting, where a depth and a pose networks are simultaneously learned from unlabeled monocular videos.

The introduction of semantic information to improve depth estimates has been explored in prior works, and can be broadly divided into two categories. The first one uses semantic (or instance) information to mask out or properly model dynamic portions of the image, which are not accounted for in the photometric loss calculation.

The paper \"Deep linear networks with arbitrary loss: All local minima are global\" by Thomas Laurent and James Brecht, shows that deep linear networks with arbitrary loss functions have all local minima that are global optima.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have studied the linear convergence properties of gradient descent for one-hidden-layer Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with random initialization. We showed that the convergence rate and depth of the network have an impact on the landscape of the minimizers. We presented a new hypothesis which is consistent with the evidence and empirically validated by thorough experiments. We have also shown that random initialization can converge to a minimum which is not minimal. Our", "evaluation": "rouge"}
{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "This paper studies the convergence of gradient descent on the squared loss of deep linear neural networks. The authors prove linear convergence rate if (1) the network dimensions are big enough so that the full product can have full rank, (2) the singular values of each weight matrices are approximately the same, (3) the initialized point is \u201cclose enough\u201d to the target.\n\nMy main concern about the study of GD on linear neural network is whether we really get any \u201cbenefit\u201d or \u201cacceleration\u201d from depth, i.e., is GD on linear neural nets any faster than GD on linear models. It\u2019s been shown that we get acceleration in some cases (e.g., $\\ell_p$ regression when $p>2$ [Arora et al. 18\u2019]), but some other results (e.g., [Shamir 18\u2019] mentioned in Section 5) show that GD on linear neural nets (when weight matrices are all scalar) suffer exponential (in depth) increase in convergence time at near zero region, due to the vanishing gradient phenomenon. From my understanding, this paper circumvents this problem by assuming deficiency margin, because in the setting of [Shamir 18\u2019], deficiency margin means that the initialized product ($W_{1:N}$) has the same sign as $\\Phi$ and far enough from zero, so we don\u2019t have to pass through the near-zero region.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll list specific concerns/questions/comments.\n* In my opinion, the statements about \u201cnecessity\u201d of two key assumptions are too strong, because the authors only provide counterexamples of non-convergence. As [Theorem 3, Shamir 18\u2019] shows (although in scalar case), even when the assumptions are not satisfied, a convergence rate $O(exp(N) * log(1/\\epsilon))$ is possible. It will be an interesting future work to clearly delineate the boundary between convergence and non-convergence.\n\n* In Thm 2 and Claim 3, what happens if dimension $d_0$ is smaller? What is the reason that you had to restrict it to high dimension? Is it due to high variance with few samples?\n\n* In Thm 2, constants $d\u2019_0$ and $a$ hide the dependence of the result on p, but I would suggest stating the dependence of those parameters on p, and also dependence on other parameters such as N.\n\n* In Section 5, there is a statement \u201cThis negative result, a theoretical manifestation of the \u201cvanishing gradient problem\u201d, is circumvented by balanced initialization.\u201d Can you elaborate more on that?

Additionally, in Bayesian Compression the required bit-precision per layer is determined via the posterior variance. In contrast to our method, Bayesian Compression does not explicitly enforce clustering of weights during training and thus requires bit-widths in the range between 5 and 18 bits. Extending our method to include group-constraints for pruning is an interesting direction for future work. Another Bayesian method for simultaneous network quantization and pruning is soft weight-sharing (SWS) (Ullrich et al., 2017), which uses a Gaussian mixture model prior (and a KL term without trainable parameters such that the KL term reduces to the prior entropy). SWS acts like a probabilistic version of k-means clustering with the advantage of automatic collapse of unnecessary mixture components. Similar to learning the codebooks in our method, soft weight-sharing learns the prior from the data, a technique known as empirical Bayes. We cannot directly compare against soft weight-sharing since the authors do not report results on ternary networks. Gal et al. (2017) learn dropout rates by using a continuous relaxation of dropout\u2019s discrete masks (via the concrete distribution). The authors learn layer-wise dropout rates, which does not allow for dropout-rate-based pruning.

Existing works rely on choosing between a menu of pre-specified module primitives, using different module types to solve subproblems involving specific input-output datatypes, without addressing how these modules\u2019 forms are to be discovered in the first place. In this paper, we show a single generic module architecture is capable of automatically learning to solve a wide variety of different tasks in a unified action/state space, and a simple controller scheme is able to switch between such modules. Our results are also closely connected with the literature on lifelong (or continual) learning (Kirkpatrick et al., 2016; Rusu et al., 2016). A part of this literature is concerned with learning to solve new tasks without catastrophically forgetting how to solve old ones (Zenke et al., 2017; Kirkpatrick et al., 2016). The use of modules obviates this problem, but instead shifts the hard question to one of how newly-allocated modules can be learned effectively. The continual learning literature also directly addresses knowlege transfer to newly allocated structures (Chen et al., 2015; Rusu et al., 2016; Fernando et al., 2017), but largely addresses how transfer learning can lead to higher performance, rather than addressing how it can improve learning speed.

Another exciting recent work is perturbative variational inference (Bamler et al., 2017) which considers different objective functions for variational inference; we are not sure whether there exists a deeper relationship to debiasing schemes. There also exists a large body of work that uses the ELBO objective but considers ways to enlarge the variational family.

Around the same time the general framework of normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) unified the previous works as some invertible continuous transformation of a distribution.

Starting by studying the bias of the IWAE bound for approximating log-marginal likelihood, the authors propose to make use of debiasing techniques to improve the approximation. For the binarized MNIST the authors show improved approximations given the same number of samples from the auxiliary distribution q(z|x).\n\nJVI seems to be an interesting extension of, and perspective on, the IWAE bound (and other Monte Carlo objectives). Some questions and comments:\n\n* The Cremer et al. (2017) paper contains some errors when interpreting the IWAE bound as a standard ELBO with a more flexible variational approximation distribution. For example eq. (1) in their paper does not correspond to an actual distribution, it is not properly normalized. This makes the connection in their section 2.1 unclear. I would suggest citing the following paper instead for this connection and the relation to importance sampling (IS):\nNaesseth, Linderman, Ranganath, Blei, \"Variational Sequential Monte Carlo\", 2017.\n\n* Regarding the analysis of the IWAE bound the paper by Rainforth et al. (2017) mentioned in the comments seems very relevant. Also, because of the strong connection between IWAE and IS detailed in the Naesseth et al. (2017) paper it is possible to make use of a standard Taylor approximation/delta methods to derive Prop. 1 and Prop. 2, see e.g. Robert & Casella, \"Monte Carlo Statistical Methods\" or Liu's \"Monte Carlo Strategies for Scientific Computing\".\n\n* It could be worth mentioning that the JVI objective function is now no longer (I think?) a lower bound to the log-evidence.\n\n* Could the surprising issue (IWAE-learned, JV1-evaluated being better than JV1-learned, JV1-evaluated) in Table 1 be because of different local optima?\n\n* Also, we can easily get unbiased estimates of the evidence p(x) using IS and optimize this objective wrt to model parameters. The proposal parameters can be optimized to minimize variance, how do you think this compares to the proposed method?\n\nMinor comments:\n* p(x) -> p_\\theta(x)\n* In the last paragraph of section 1 it seems like you claim that the expressiveness of p_\\theta(x|z) is a limitation of VAE.

To that end, we leverage the posterior regularization framework and show that this constraint satisfaction problem can be formulated as sampling from a Gibbs distribution. The main challenges come from the black-box nature of those physical constraints, since they are obtained via solving highly non-linear PDEs. To overcome those difficulties, we introduce Surrogate-based Constrained Langevin dynamics for black-box sampling. We explore two surrogate approaches.

In practice, this approach can be prohibitive since we still need to often query the expensive PDE solvers. The second approach approximates the gradients in the Langevin dynamics with deep neural networks, allowing us an efficient sampling strategy using the surrogate model. We prove the convergence of those two approaches when the target distribution is log-concave and smooth.

The condition on eta should be a theta(f (K)) for some f type of condition like in the second part of the theorem. I would suggest the authors to look into the theorem - or claify why this is the case. \n\nI am confused by the presentation of the Shi et al results as there is no penalty appearing for the approximation error due to an RKHS, only a finite sample penalty.

Other deterministic approaches are based on Laplace\u2019s approximation (MacKay, 1992): Kirkpatrick et al. (2017) use multiple diagonal Gaussian posterior approximations of previous time-steps to regularise future tasks; Ritter et al.

Our work is based on online VB (Opper, 1998; Ghahramani, 2000; Sato, 2001; Broderick et al., 2013), which approximates the posterior at every time-step by minimising the KL-divergence between a parametric (here Gaussian) and the true posterior distribution. In contrast to online VB, we approximate the posterior by a Gaussian distribution and a running memory. Other approaches are based on various types of episodic memory, motivated by their empirical success in preventing catastrophic forgetting.

This setting assumes that the data distribution is non-stationary, meaning that the underlying parameters of the data distribution change over time. Variational Bayesian learning is a popular approach to online learning that uses stochastic approximations to estimate the posterior distribution in the presence of model misspecification and learning non-stationary data distributions.\n\nSome previous work in online variational Bayesian learning includes the development of online variational Bayesian inference (MacKay, 1992), the use of online structured Laplace approximations (Ritter et al., 2018) to overcome catastrophic forgetting, and the use of Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the gradients in deep generative replay (Shin et al., 2017). There have also been studies on continual learning with deep generative replay (Shin et al., 2017) and online model selection based on variational Bayes (Sato, 2001), all addressing the problem of learning from non-stationary data distributions.

This paper discusses the application of running memory for online Bayesian inference, and the use of a Gaussian prior to model the likelihood functions of data that appear in the memory.

Summary:\nThis proposes considers neural networks training with non-stationary streaming data. To address online inference, the paper uses variational online updates and a running memory (coreset) summarising the data points seen so far, as recently used in the variational continual learning approach. First, the paper identifies a gap in this recent approach that coreset point selection process does not take into account the approximation quality. The paper develops a sound procedure to select the memory points, essentially to identify \u201cdifficult\u201d data points under the current posterior and put them into the running memory. Second, to handle \u201cconcept drift\u201d, the paper considers imposing some decaying on the likelihood of past data and derives post-hoc variational posterior updates for this case. Two contributions are validated on some streaming regression and classification tasks.\n\n2. Opinion and rationales\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards \u201caccept\u201d for this paper since it presents two interesting contributions (albeit of incremental novelty)  to the approximate inference area, it has clear execution and super clean presentation, and the experiments clearly demonstrate the values of the proposed approaches.\n\nI would like the paper to clarify the following:\n\na. I find the objective for selecting memory points interesting, but am wondering if using individual predictability terms by themselves are good enough to select these points. Perhaps, after some thoughts, memory is perhaps not the right word to characterise these points. \n\nIt seems to me (i) these terms indicate how well the current posterior predicts the data points and thus this objective will tend to favour points with low predictive likelihood to be selected. That is, these points are important when *all other points* are presented, (ii) there will be *no diversity* in the memory as illustrated in the 2d classification example.\n\nThis means the points selected here have quite different characteristics compared to coreset points or the full dataset in general. Coreset points ideally can compactly represent the full dataset and can be used for inference in place of the full dataset.\n\nThat said, the contribution presented here is very useful. Just that I\u2019m not sure how well this will work in more challenging continual learning set-up where diversity is important for a long sequence of diverse tasks.\n\nb. The paper presents a post-hoc modification to approximate posterior (\u2018s mean and variance) to account for the decay in the likelihood contribution from past data. I wonder if this post-hoc adjustment is identical to running approximate inference with the adjusted likelihood?\n\nc. the adaptation parameters need to be tuned/known in advance, which seems to be a disadvantage of the current approach. Is the update presented here somewhat robust to mis-specification of these parameters? How would these be tuned in a more practical setting in which data arrive sequentially and we might not know the underlying \u201cconcept\u201d.\n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

(Vasilescu & Terzopoulos, 2002), in their framework of TensorFaces, proposed to treat facial image data as multidimensional arrays and analyze them with tensor decompositions, which led to significant boost in face recognition accuracy. (Bailey & Aeron, 2017) employed higher-order co-occurence data and tensor factorization techniques to improve on word embeddings models. Tensor methods also allow to produce more accurate and robust recommender systems by taking into account a multifaceted nature of real environments (Frolov & Oseledets, 2017). In recent years a great deal of work was done in applications of tensor calculus to both theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning algorithms. (Lebedev et al., 2015) represented filters in a convolutional network with CP decomposition (Harshman, 1970; Carroll & Chang, 1970) which allowed for much faster inference at the cost of a negligible drop in performance. (Novikov et al., 2015) proposed to use Tensor Train (TT) decomposition (Oseledets, 2011) to compress fully\u2013connected layers of large neural networks while preserving their expressive power. Later on, TT was exploited to reduce the number of parameters and improve the performance of recurrent networks in long\u2013term forecasting (Yu et al., 2017) and video classification (Yang et al., 2017) problems. In addition to the practical benefits, tensor decompositions were used to analyze theoretical aspects of deep neural nets. (Cohen et al., 2016) investigated a connection between various network architectures and tensor decompositions, which made possible to compare their expressive power. Specifically, it was shown that CP and Hierarchial Tucker (Grasedyck, 2010) decompositions correspond to shallow networks and convolutional networks respectively. Recently, this analysis was extended by (Khrulkov et al., 2018) who showed that TT decomposition can be represented as a recurrent network with multiplicative connections. This specific form of RNNs was also empirically proved to provide a substantial performance boost over standard RNN models (Wu et al., 2016). First results on the connection between tensor decompositions and neural networks were obtained for rather simple architectures, however, later on, they were extended in order to analyze more practical deep neural nets. It was shown that theoretical results can be generalized to a large class of CNNs with ReLU nonlinearities (Cohen & Shashua, 2016) and dilated convolutions (Cohen et al., 2018), providing valuable insights on how they can be improved.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

The expressive power of deep learning has been studied extensively with various tensor analysis techniques, such as CP-decomposition, Tucker decomposition, and tensor train decomposition (OTU) (Khrulkov et al., 2018; Novikov & Podoprikhin, 2017). In 2015, the Tensor-train decomposition was used to reduce the number of parameters in MLP models and tensorize convolutional neural networks (Cohen et al., 2015; Oseledets, 2011). In 2016, the expressive power of recurrent neural networks was investigated, showing that RNNs are generally more powerful than MLPs (Yudistira et al., 2016). As for the rectifier nonlinearity, it was initially introduced as a simple and efficient activation function for MLPs, and was later replaced by self-activation functions in dilated convolutional networks (DCN) (Liu et al., 2017; Velickovic et al., 2017). Some works have shown that MLPs with deeper and wider layers can be more expressive (Melis et al., 2017; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014). However, little has been explored in relation to tensor-train networks or other tensor analysis-based models.\n\nIn 2018, Cohen et al. introduced generalized shallow networks with the rectifier nonlinearity, showcasing its power in handling various types of data. They also demonstrated that tensor-train networks can be exponentially more efficient than shallow networks for certain types of data (Khrulkov et al., 2018). In 2020, Chen et al. proposed the use of tensor-train RNNs for sequence-to-sequence (autoencoding) tasks, achieving better performance than other architectures in certain cases (Chen et al., 2020). To further expand on these findings, this paper investigates deeper and wider RNN networks with various nonlinearities and their relation to tensor analysis.

This allows the model to generate translations for each segment as it arrives without having to wait for the entire sentence to be processed.

For example, Feynman-Kac Formalism can be used to improve robustness (Wang et al., 2018). In this paper, we focus on the classification setting, where the goal is to provide guarantee of a constant prediction among a small region specified via some metric. The robustness certificate can be either exact or conservative, so long as a constant prediction is guaranteed in the certified region. Note that the certification of a completely black-box model requires checking the prediction values at every point around the point of interest, which is clearly infeasible. A practical certification algorithm inevitably has to specify and leverage the functional structure of the classifier in use to reduce the required computation. Exact certificates. The exact certificate of deep networks is typically derived for the networks with a piecewise linear activation function such as ReLU. Such networks have an equivalent mixed integer linear representation (Cheng et al., 2017; Lomuscio & Maganti, 2017; Dutta et al., 2017; Bunel et al., 2018). Hence, one may apply mixed integer linear programming to find the worst case adversary within any convex polyhedron such as an `1-ball or `\u221e-ball. Despite the elegant solution, the complexity is, in general, NP-hard and the algorithms are not scalable to large problems(Tjeng et al., 2017). Conservative certificates. A conservative certificate can be more scalable than the exact methods, since one can trade-off the accuracy of certification with efficiency (Gouk et al., 2018; Tsuzuku et al., 2018; Cisse et al., 2017; Anil et al., 2018; Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017). For example, one can relax the search of the worst case adversary as a simpler optimization problem that only bounds the effect of such adversary. Alternatively, people also consider the robustness problem in a modular way, where the robustness guarantee can be derived iteratively for each layer in the deep networks by considering the feasible values for each hidden layer (Gowal et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018).", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

Conventional regularization methods have rarely been applied in deep RL. One rare case of such use is in Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) (Lillicrap et al., 2016), where Batch Normalization is applied to all layers of the actor \u00b5 network and layers of the critic Q network prior to the action input, and L2 regularization is applied to the critic Q network because it tends to have overestimation bias (Fujimoto et al., 2018). Some recent studies have developed more complicated regularization approaches to continuous control tasks. Cheng et al. (2019) regularizes the stochastic action distribution \u03c0(a|s) using a suboptimal control prior. The regularization weight at a given state is adjusted based on the temporal difference (TD) error. The larger the TD error, the more the action distribution moves towards the prior. Galashov et al. (2019) introduces a default policy that receives limited information as a regularizer. The information asymmetry between the behavior policy and the default policy helps to accelerate convergence and improve performance. Parisi et al. (2019) introduces TD error regularization to penalize inaccurate value estimation and Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Schulman et al., 2016) regularization to penalize GAE variance. However, most of these regularizations are rather complicated (Galashov et al., 2019), specifically designed for certain algorithms (Parisi et al., 2019), or need prior information (Cheng et al., 2019).

In RL, the agent interacts with an environment and learns from the interactions to perform actions and maximize a reward function. In recent years, RL has gained a lot of attention due to its potential applications in various fields such as robotics, gaming, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nIn RL, a wide range of algorithms have been developed to help the agent learn from its experiences and improve its performance. Some of the commonly used RL algorithms include:\n\n1. Q-Learning: This is a type of off-policy algorithm that updates its internal Q-value table based on selected actions in state-action pairs.\n2. Policy Gradient: This is a popular on-policy method that learns a policy directly using stochastic gradient ascent of the policy objective.\n3. Deep Q-Networks (DQN): This is an off-policy algorithm that combines Q-Learning and neural networks by using a deep neural network to approximate the Q-values.\n4. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): This is an on-policy algorithm that uses a trust region optimization method to optimize the policy.\n5. Actor-Critic Methods: This is a class of algorithms that use both an actor and a critic to learn the policy. The actor computes the policy, while the critic evaluates the quality of the policy.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many RL algorithms that have been developed over the years. Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem being solved.\n\nA potential issue with RL algorithms is that the performance of the agent can depend heavily on the quality of the data it collects. To mitigate this risk, RL algorithms often use regularization techniques to help the agent learn more generalizable policies. Some of the most commonly used regularization techniques in RL include:\n\n1. Dropout: This method randomly omits some neurons during training time in the neural network, leading to the exposure of the network to different distributions of inputs and helping it learn more robust networks.\n2. Batch Normalization: This technique re-scales and shifts the input to each neuron using learned parameters, in order to normalize the distribution of inputs and help the neural network focus more on the variability in the input than on the absolute values.\n3. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): This is a on-policy algorithm that uses trials (or samples) from a random number of children in the search tree in order to help the agent choose the best action.\n4.

The techniques proposed by this paper lack novelty. For instance, the entire section 3.2 is simply the original design of the multi-head self-attention by Vaswani et al. The major difference between R-Transformer and the original Transformer is the replacement of positional embedding with an RNN layer, but (in my opinion) the authors did not demonstrate sufficiently its effectiveness via ablative studies (see below). Moreover, some prior works have already exploited the locality structure in Transformers. For instance, [1] showed that a sparse, local Transformer can work extremely well and be very efficient (they achieved SOTA on large-scale char-level language modeling tasks).\n\n2. The experiments do not entirely convince me. \n    i) The authors use the \"same hidden size for R-Transformer and Transformer.\" But in fact, as the R-Transformer has one extra RNN/LSTM/GRU layer at every level of the network, the tests were carried out (in effect) using a larger model than the baselines. I think the authors should instead control the # of model parameters, especially since you are running only on small tasks with small-sized models.\n    ii) It is nice that the authors tested R-Transformer on a variety of tasks--- this is important. However, in no way do these number achieve the levels of the \"state-of-the-art\", which the authors claim at the end of Section 1 (e.g., [2] has better number on seqMNIST and character-level PTB, and the Transformer-XL actually achieves <55 perplexity on word-level PTB).

The problem of covariate shift was already observed, as the author notes: \u201cthe network must not solely be shown examples of accurate driving, but also how to recover once a mistake has been made\u201d. This issue was formalized in the work of (Ross & Bagnell, 2010), who on one hand proved an O( T 2) regret bound, and on the other hand provided an example showing this bound is tight. The subsequent work (Ross et al., 2011) proposed the DAGGER algorithm which obtains linear regret, provided the agent can both interact with the environment, and query the expert policy. Our approach also requires environment interaction, but importantly does not need to query the expert. note is the work of (Venkatraman et al., 2015), which extended DAGGER to time series prediction problems by using the true targets as expert corrections. Imitation learning has been used within the context of modern RL to help improve sample efficiency (Chang et al., 2015; Ross & Bagnell, 2014; Sun et al., 2017; Hester et al., 2018; Le et al., 2018; Cheng & Boots, 2018) or overcome exploration (Nair et al., 2017). These settings assume the reward is known and that the policies can then be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. In this case, covariate shift is less of an issue since it can be corrected using the reinforcement signal. The work of (Luo et al., 2019) also proposed a method to address the covariate shift problem when learning from demonstrations when the reward is known, by conservatively extrapolating the value function outside the training distribution using negative sampling. This addresses a different setting from ours, and requires generating plausible states which are off the manifold of training data, which may be challenging when the states are high dimensional such as images. The work of (Reddy et al., 2019) proposed to treat imitation learning within the Q-learning framework, setting a positive reward for all transitions inside the demonstration data and zero reward for all other transitions in the replay buffer.

While it is possible to train regression networks to output the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, the resulting model remains oblivious to the underlying confidence of its predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters. We observe that our evidential regression method learns well-calibrated measures of uncertainty on various benchmarks, scales to complex computer vision tasks, and is robust to adversarial input perturbations.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

To alleviate this limitation and provide more robust uncertainty estimates, we introduce a novel training approach that injects a higher-order likelihood distribution to directly estimate model uncertainty as well as the lack of information around it, referred to as evidential probability. Our approach mitigates biases of standard methods by utilizing Maximum Likelihood estimation (MLE) and Bayesian inference to achieve a more reliable estimation of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty. Prior works in this field (Sensoy et al., 2018; Malinin & Gales, 2018) have focused exclusively on modeling uncertainty in the classification domain with Dirichlet prior distributions.

The classical Bayesian formulations of uncertainty have been widely used for decision making in many application fields, including image classification, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. However, these methods may require either explicit model selection or large models, leading to increased inference time and model size. In contrast, deep ensembles and Bayesian dropout can account for noise in the training data, but their coverage is bounded by the number of models used in the ensemble.\n\nSeveral methods have been proposed to tackle these limitations. Variational inference has been used to compute uncertain predictions by maximizing a lower bound of the model evidence. However, the Bayesianity of these methods is yet to be fully established. Variational autoencoders have been proposed for generating samples of neural network functions conditioned on input data. However, the quality of these samples depends on the quality of the encoder and the generator.\n\nOther methods have focused on estimating the epistemic uncertainty in the model, which represents the knowledge gap between the model and the training data. Gaussian processes and Bayesian linear regression can be used to compute the posterior distribution over function inputs. However, computing gradients for deep neural networks poses a challenge.\n\nRecently, we proposed an approach that combines both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by regularizing the output distribution of neural networks using an evidential prior. The prior is based on a conjugate prior for multivariate Gaussian distributions, which is conjugate to any prior distribution. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in benchmarking datasets and in complex computer vision tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, the field of uncertainty estimation in neural networks is a fascinating one, with many challenges and opportunities for research.

GuessWhat is one of the famous taskoriented dialog tasks, where the goal is to figure out a target object in the image through a dialog that the answerer has in mind (de Vries et al., 2017). However, GuessWhat is relatively an easy task because it only allows the answer form of yes or no. The baseline visual question answering (VQA) model achieves 78.5%. In the object guessing task (i.e., GuessWhat task itself), the state-of-the-art averaged accuracy of SL, RL (Zhang et al., 2018b), and AQM (Lee et al., 2018) reached 44.6% and 60.8%, and 72.9% at the 5th round, respectively. Random guessing baseline has an accuracy of\n16.0% (Han et al., 2017), thus RL algorithms achieve 53.3% error decrease, whereas AQM achieves 67.7%. GuessWhich is a cooperative two-player game that one player tries to figure out an image out of 9,628 that another has in mind (Das et al., 2017b). GuessWhich uses Visual Dialog dataset (Das et al., 2017a) which includes human dialogs on MSCOCO images (Lin et al., 2014) as well as the captions that are generated. Although GuessWhich is similar to GuessWhat, it is more challenging in every task including asking a question, giving an answer, and guessing the target class. For example, unlike GuessWhat that can be answered in yes or no, the answer can be an arbitrary sentence in GuessWhich. Therefore, the VQA task in the Visual Dialog dataset is much studied than the GuessWhat dataset (Lu et al., 2017; Seo et al., 2017b). Similar to GuessWhat, SL and RL approaches have been applied to solve the GuessWhich task and they showed a moderate increase in performance (Das et al., 2017b; Jain et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a). However, based on the authors\u2019 recent Github implementation1 of the papers in ICCV (Das et al., 2017b), SL and RL methods have shown that only 6% of error is diminished through the dialog compared to the zeroth turn baselines which only use generated caption.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

It generates candidate questions and answers at every turn, and selects top candidate questions from AprxAgen using beam search. AQM+ also uses Qpost to find an appropriate question from the training set. It has been shown to significantly reduce the error in a GuessWhich game, while retaining a large scale of the problem. The proposed AQM+ algorithm has three main benefits over the original AQM algorithm: better generalization to tasks, better handling of large-scale problems and better sampling efficiency.\n\nGenerating candidate questions and selecting the best one improves the performance of the system while making it robust to the changes in the target state. AQM++ allows for more information to be extracted from the model, improving its ability to make predictions about the future. The algorithm also takes into account the uncertainty of the model, which is an important feature for robustness. Finally, AQM++ is more computationally efficient than AQM+, as it only needs to do about half as many operations per iteration. All of these factors make AQM++ an attractive option for real-world applications such as robotics.\n\nAQM+ is a generalization of the original AQM algorithm that allows it to handle more complex task-oriented dialogs. In the original AQM framework, the system generates questions given a caption and searches for an answer in the training set. AQM+ uses a dialog simulation to create dialogues that are more realistic and interesting, and the system can actively learn from the dialogue by using reinforcement learning.

Also, in applications such as robotics, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm can be manipulated to produce arbitrary errors.

The presence of noise is very common in real-world environments, especially in robotics-relevant applications. Consequently, robust (adversarial) reinforcement learning (RRL/RARL) algorithms have been widely studied, aiming to train a robust policy which is capable of withstanding perturbed observations (Teh et al., 2017; Pinto et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2018) or transferring to unseen environments (Rajeswaran et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2017).

Apart from the work cited by the paper (and perhaps work like Krueger et al. (2016), in which agents must pay some cost to observe true rewards), there is little work on learning settings of this kind. This paper represents a first step in gaining clarity on how to formalize and study this problem. I did, however, find the analysis and the experiments to be relatively disjointed -- the main sample complexity result presented by the paper (Theorem 2) was given for Phased Q-Learning, yet no experiments actually evaluate the performance of Phased Q-Learning. I think the paper could benefit from experiments focused on simple domains that showcase how traditional algorithms do in cases where it is easier to understand (and visualize) the impact of the reward perturbations (simple chain MDPs, grid worlds, etc.) -- and specifically experiments including Phased Q-Learning. \n\nSection 1) Introduction:\n\t- \"adversaries in real-world\" --> \"adversaries in the real-world\"\n\t- You might consider citing Loftin et al. (2014) regarding the bulleted point about \"Application-Specific Noise\".\n\t- \"unbiased reward estimator aided reward robust reinforcement learning framework\" --> this was a bit hard to parse. Consider making more concise, like: \"unbiased reward estimator for use in reinforcement learning with perturbed rewards\".\n\t- \"Our solution framework builds on existing reinforcement learning algorithms, including the recently developed DRL ones\" --> cite these up front So, cite: Q-Learning, CEM, SARSA, DQN, Dueling DQN, DDPG, NAF, and PPO, and spell out the acronym for each the first time you introduce them.\n\t- \"layer of explorations\" --> \"layer of exploration\"\n\nSection 2) Problem Formulation\n\t- \"as each shot of our\" --> what is 'shot' in this context?\n\t- \"In what follow,\" --> \"In what follows,\"\n\t- \"where 0 < \\gamma \\leq 1\" --> Usually, $\\gamma \\in [0,1)$, or $[0,1]$. Why can't $\\gamma = 0$?\n\t- The transition notation changes between $\\mathbb{P}_a(s_{t+1} | s_t)$ and $\\mathbb{P}(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$. I'd suggest picking one and sticking with it to improve clarity.\n\t- \"to learn a state-action value function, for example the Q-function\" --> Why is the Q-function just an example? Isn't is *the* state-action value function? That is, I'd suggest replacing \"to learn a state-action value function, for example the Q-function\" with \"to learn a state-action value function, also called the Q-function\"\n\t- \"Q-function calculates\" --> \"The Q-function denotes\"\n\t- \"the reward feedbacks perfectly\" --> \"the reward feedback perfectly\"\n\t- I prefer that the exposition of the perturbed reward MDP be done with C in the tuple. So: $\\tilde{M} = \\langle \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{R}, C, \\mathcal{P}, \\gamma \\rangle$. This seems the most appropriate definition, since the observed rewards will be generated by $C$.\n\t- The setup of the confusion matrix for reward noise over is very clean. It might be worth pointing out that $C$ need not be Markovian. There are cases where C is not just a function of $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{R}$, like the adversarial case you describe early on.\n\n\n4) Experiments:\n\t- Diverse experiments! That's great. Lots of algorithms, lots of environment types.\n\t- I expected to see Phrased Q-Learning in the experiments.

The noise can cause the agents to behave unexpectedly and arrive at suboptimal solutions. To deal with this problem, the method estimates the true reward distribution and uses it to construct an unbiased estimator for the true rewards. This estimator is then used to train the agent's policy. The research proposes a new way to estimate the reward function by assuming that the true reward distribution is not known but can be approximated by estimating its confusion matrix. The paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for the proposed method and demonstrates its effectiveness on several real-world reinforcement learning problems. The results show that the proposed method can improve the convergence rate and generalize well to unseen environments. However, there are some limitations to this research. One limitation is that the proposed method assumes that the confusion matrix is known or can be estimated. In real-world situations, this assumption may not be true, and other methods may be needed to estimate the confusion matrix. Another limitation is that the proposed method only addresses the noisy rewards problem and does not address other challenges faced by reinforcement learning. For example, the agent may need to deal with noisy input, uncertain environment state, or non-stationary reward functions. Therefore, the proposed method may need to be adjusted or combined with other techniques to tackle these challenges.

In this paper we propose a retriever-reader model that learns to attend on essential terms during the question answering process.

However, there are still challenges, especially when it comes to answering questions where the answer type is not explicitly stated in the question itself. This was highlighted in the TriviaQA and SQuAD datasets, which focus on relatively short, single-choice questions. In an attempt to address these challenges, we propose a new QA model called ET-RR, which uses a retriever-reader pipeline to overcome ambiguities in questions. The retriever component first retrieves relevant evidence from open-domain texts before the reader component predicts the correct answer.\nThe key to our model is an essential-term-aware retriever-reader (ET-RR), which selects the most relevant information for answering the question. This is achieved by first identifying relevant passages from the open-domain texts and then using an attention-enhanced reader to select the most suitable answer from those passages. The reader module takes into account the question, passages, and answer choices to predict the correct answer. Our model outperforms existing QA models on the ARC, RACE-Open, and MCScript-Open datasets. In particular, the ET-RR model achieves an accuracy of 36.61% on the test set of the ARC dataset, outperforming the current state-of-the-art model by 8.1%.\n\nWhile ET-RR addresses some of the challenges in open-domain QA, it is important to note that there are still areas that require further exploration. For example, the performance of our model could be improved by incorporating commonsense knowledge or training on more diverse datasets.

Motivated by this observation, they built a sentence selector to gather this potential evidence for use by the reader model. Nishida et al. (2018) developed a multi-task learning (MTL) method for a retriever and reader in order to obtain a strong retriever that considers certain passages including the answer text as positive samples during training. The proposed MTL framework is still limited to the scenario when it is feasible to discover whether the passages contain the answer span. Although these works have achieved progress on open-domain QA by improving the ranking or selection of given evidence, few have focused on the scenario where the model needs to start by searching for the evidence itself.

Several approaches have been proposed in the past to tackle this problem in the context of open-domain question answering. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in neural network-based models, which have shown promising results on large-scale datasets.\n\nOne such approach is the \"Retriever-Reader\" model, which has been recently introduced by a group of researchers led by Bo Zhou at Facebook AI. The goal of this model is to learn a joint representation of a question and a set of candidate answers, so that it can rank the answers based on their relevance to the question. The model is trained by predicting the log-probability of each candidate answer given the question and the passage, and the ranking is learned through reinforcement learning.\n\nThe Retriever-Reader model consists of two main components: a neural retriever and a neural reader. The neural retriever is responsible for querying a search engine with the question and a set of candidate answers, and retrieving the most relevant passage for each candidate answer. The neural reader then takes the retrieved passages, along with the question and the answer choices, and predicts the best answer choice for the given question.\n\nThe authors of the Retriever-Reader model have reported state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, including the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and the TriviaQA dataset. However, the Retriever-Reader model is not without its limitations. One potential limitation is that it requires a large amount of training data to achieve good performance, which may not be always available. Additionally, the model may be sensitive to the quality of the input data, such as the relevance of the retrieved passages and the quality of the text in the candidate answers.\n\nTo address these limitations, the present paper proposes a new approach based on the Retriever-Reader model, which incorporates a new neural network architecture called the Essential-Term-Aware Retriever-Reader (ET-RR) model. This network is designed to select the most important words in a question, which are referred to as essential terms, and to find relevant passages based on these terms. The model is trained by generating a set of predefined essential terms for each question in its training data, and then learning to identify these terms in the input query and the set of candidate answers.\n\nThe ET-RR model achieves state-of-the-art results on the Large-Scale Conversational AI (Large-Scale) benchmark dataset, outperforming several existing neural network-based models by a large margin. This suggests that the new approach is promising for real world applications, and that it may be effective for a wide range of natural language processing tasks.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The above two proposed modules (reader and selector) are not very novel, but are still valid contributions to me. Experiments on the ARC dataset shows that (1) the proposed reader itself improves over the state-of-the-art on the leaderboard; (2) introducing the essential term selector further improves the above results by about 2%.\n\nAlthough the paper also provides additional experiments on other datasets, I feel that the contributions of the proposed methods are not sufficiently verified. I would suggest the authors consider the following further experiments that I believe could improve its ratings:\n\n(1) The proposed reader works very well on ARC. However, besides the BiDAF, there is no comparison between the proposed reader and previous models on datasets other than ARC. In order to know whether the result generalizes or not, I think the authors should conduct experiments on the regular RACE or other multi-choice QA datasets, to fully test the reader model.\n\n(2) It is not clear whether the essential term selector could help on datasets other than science questions. Again, the authors reported results on two other datasets. However, on neither of these datasets the ET-RR was compared with ET-RR (Concat). Therefore, I have concerns that the proposed framework may only be significant on the ARC dataset.\n\nMoreover, it will be interesting to see whether the essential term selector can be learned from distant supervision. For example, using REINFORCE to learn the selector model with the rewards from the end-task performance.

In a low dimensional world, this makes total sense, however, I fail to understand what kind of barrier it implies on the geometry of the landscape: Can the 1-dimensional lines be on the sides of a valley? Can one find *another* 1-dimensional projection for which the inequality is broken? How do such dependencies change the understanding of the problem? And if one is indeed only interested in the flat line segments (since SGD is making discrete steps), then one can, in principle, observe barrier crossing in a convex problem, as well? Is there an argument for otherwise? Or if it is a notion that applies equally well in a convex case then how should we really think about the barrier crossing? On the opposite point of view, can one not imagine a barrier crossing that doesn't appear in this triangular inequality above?\n\nThe paper is full of empirical evidence that is guided by a simple observable that is very intuitive, however, it lacks a comprehensive discussion on the new quantity they propose that I consider a major flaw, but that I think (hope) that the authors can fix very easily. Some minor points that would improve the readability and clarity for the reader:\n- The figures are not very reader-friendly, this can be improved by better using the whitespaces in the paper but it can also be improved by finding further observables that would summarize the observations instead of showing individual consecutive line interpolations.\n- What are the values of the y-axis in Figure 5 and 6? Are they the top eigenvalues of the Hessian?\n- In the models that are compared in Figure 7, what are their generalization properties (early stopping and otherwise)?\n- The interpretation at the end of p. 6 may be a good motivation for the reader if it had been introduced earlier for that section.\n\n\n4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

The authors find that SGD is unable to cross barriers in the loss surface during training, and instead moves over these barriers at a much slower rate. Experiments are conducted on multiple datasets and architectures, and the results are robust across different hyperparameters.\nThe paper provides important insights into the behavior of SGD during optimization, which can be used to guide the development of more effective optimization methods. However, there are some limitations and questions that arise from the paper.\nFirst, the experiments are conducted on a variety of architectures and datasets, but the results may not be generalizable to other architectures or settings. Further experiments and analysis are needed to ensure that the findings of this paper are consistent across different architectures and training scenarios.\nSecond, the authors assume that SGD moves along the loss surface in a random fashion, but it is not clear how this assumption might be derived or tested. The paper would benefit from a more rigorous test of this assumption, and an analysis of how the behavior of SGD changes as a function of other parameters, such as learning rate and mini-batch size.\nFinally, the authors find that SGD avoids crossing barriers in the loss landscape, but they do not provide a quantitative measure of the distance traveled over these barriers. A more detailed analysis of the behavior of SGD over different types of barriers would be valuable in guiding the development of more effective optimization methods.\nIn conclusion, this paper provides valuable insights into the behavior of SGD in the loss landscape of deep neural networks. However, the findings must be validated in further experiments and analysis, and the limitations of the current analysis must be acknowledged.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: \"Fear of dying alone.\" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation \"manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,\" Herman argues\u2014like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. \"It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company \u2026 missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades\" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \"There already is an apple,\" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that \"Microsoft needed to make a bold move\" or face \"certain terminal decline,\" and that the price it paid for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable.\" Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform\u2014a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move\u2014to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone.

Microsoft paid $7.2 billion for the Finnish company, including the assumption of most of Nokia's debt. Most industry analysts believe the deal was driven by Microsoft's need to become a \"one-stop shop\" for both hardware and software. The company had already shifted away from its traditional market leader position in the PC market, and the acquisition of Nokia will help it extend its reach into mobile devices.\n\nWhile some have questioned the wisdom of the deal, Microsoft has consistently praised the deal as a positive move for the company and its customers. In announcing the deal, Microsoft's then-CEO Steve Ballmer said that Nokia would bring \"real innovation and speed to market that will help us reshape the device market and our competition.\" Nokia immediately welcomed the move, with its CEO Stephen Elop saying the deal would help the company take on competitors like Apple and Google more effectively.\n\nThe deal will see Nokia become a subsidiary of Microsoft, with Microsoft keeping control of the Nokia hardware business and Nokia becoming primarily a software and services company. This suggests Microsoft sees significant potential in Nokia's services capabilities, particularly in Windows Phone, where Nokia has been pushing hard to build market share. The deal will also see Nokia and Microsoft work together on future versions of Windows Phone, which could help Nokia keep relevant in the fast-moving mobile landscape.\n\nHowever, the deal has attracted its fair share of controversy, with critics questioning the wisdom of the acquisition from both technical and financial perspectives. Some have argued that Nokia would have been better off waiting for its next-generation smartphone hardware, which may have offered better competition to both Apple and Samsung. Others have raised concerns about the financial implications of the deal, suggesting that Microsoft overpaid for the Finnish company.\n\nDespite these concerns, Microsoft has repeatedly emphasized that the deal is a positive step for the company and its customers. With Microsoft already dominating the enterprise software market, the acquisition of Nokia will help it extend its reach into the consumer market and offer a compelling \"one-stop shop\" for both small and large businesses. By bringing Nokia under its wing, Microsoft also gains valuable expertise in the rapidly expanding mobile market, where Nokia has been a major player in recent years.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. \"It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\" a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008. The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports.

SIGN UP FOR OUR FREE NEWSLETTER & WE'LL BOTHER YOU NO MORE.\n========================================\n\nHand Grips Made Easy: Discover the Advantages of MOTUS' Ergonomic Power-Grip Products\n\nHave you ever had to deal with frequent and painful back injuries from shoveling snow? Well, fear not, as MOTUS manufacturer of hand grips offers a solution to help alleviate stress on the back and shoulder. In this article, we will explore the benefits of MOTUS' ergonomic Power-Grip products for shoveling snow, as well as other tasks.\n\nThe Straight Grip (T-grip)\n-----------------------\n\nThe straight grip, also known as D-ring handle, offers a fixed hand placement at right angle to the implement shaft. On the other hand, the T-grip offers a hand placement site which is slightly displaced from the implement shaft. So, which hand grip is better? Let's take a deeper look.\n\nMethodology\n----------\n\nIn this study, we sought to asses the straight grip using a pseudo-static biomechanical assessment of the straight hand-grip Power-Grip product in a simple shoveling task. We used Newtonian equations to estimate the trunk joint moment required to hold a load with and without the straight hand-grip.\n\nResults & Analysis\n-----------------\n\nFor the straight grip, the wrist angle can remain in a near neutral position in the ulnar/radial plane. The amount of ulnar deviation is limited to a maximum of 10 degrees compared to 35 degrees for an average person. The straight grip also requires the forearms to be positioned in a pronated position. Without the use of the straight grip, the forearms would be in a supinated position.\n\nOverall, the straight grip offers a reduction in ulnar deviation and allows the user to stand taller with less back bend while holding the load. However, the straight grip may not work for all individuals, as some may take more time to adapt to the grip.\n\nThe T-grip Handle\n-----------------\n\nThe T-grip offers a hand placement site, which is similar to the straight grip. The d-ring handle provides a hand placement site which is slightly displaced from the implement shaft. The T-grip offers a straight hand-grip which improves the posture by allowing the user to stand taller with less back bend.\n\nIn addition, the T-grip handle improves neutral limb alignment and hand position, reducing fatigue and blisters. The T-grip also enhances overall ergonomic benefits for snow shovelers.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nMOTUS' hand grips offer clinicians proven benefits for the prevention and rehabilitation of low back injuries. With options such as the straight grip and T-grip handle, snow shovelers now have a better option for ergonomically efficient products. Don't let snow shovelling become a painful task, invest in a MOTUS power-grip today!", "evaluation": "rouge"}

She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University\u2014and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow\u2014so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives\u2014like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

Norfolk, Va., is also ordering residents to evacuate, and Washington, DC, has been forced to postpone Sunday's planned MLK Memorial dedication. \"This is a very, very serious situation,\" a spokeswoman for Dare County told ABC News. \"We have not seen anything like this in the lifetimes of most our residents. Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today. NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg says residents in low-lying parts of the city should get out today as the transit system is planned to be shut down tomorrow.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

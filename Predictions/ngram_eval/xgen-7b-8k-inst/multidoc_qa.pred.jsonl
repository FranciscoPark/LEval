Credits increase based on the amount of income earned, but a minimum of four credits is required to be eligible for survivor benefits. The number of credits required for benefits for survivors depends on the worker's age at their death.\n\nWhen a Family Member Dies: To report a death, call the Social Security office at 1-800-772-1213. Failure to report a death or apply online can result in a lower survivor benefit. If you need to report a death or complete a claim, fill out a claim form at the Social Security website or at your local office.\n\nDoes Social Security Pay Death Benefits? If a surviving spouse is eligible for survivor benefits, they will receive a one-time payment of $255 if they are living with the deceased or if they are caring for a child who is under age 16 or disabled. If the surviving spouse had worked long enough for Social Security, they may also be eligible for monthly benefits.\n\nWhat Happens if the Deceased Received Monthly Benefits? If the deceased was receiving monthly benefits, the living spouse must return the benefit received in July and any later benefits. They can do this by contacting the bank or their financial institution. Benefits received directly must be returned to Social Security.\n\nWho Receives Benefits? Children, parents, and certain family members may be eligible for monthly benefits. Disabled children, married children, and surviving divorced spouses can also receive benefits. Additionally, there are special situations where certain family members are eligible for benefits, such as a stepchild, grandchild, stepgrandchild, or adopted child.\n\nAre Other Family Members Eligible? Under certain circumstances, other family members may be eligible for survivor benefits. These include a stepchild, grandchild, stepgrandchild, or adopted child; and parents who were dependent on the deceased for at least half of their support.\n\nWidow or Widower: If you are the widow or widower of a person who worked long enough under Social Security, you may be eligible for survivor benefits at any age if you have not remarried and you take care of the deceased worker's child who is under age 16 or is disabled. Additionally, if you remarry after age 60 or after age 50 if you are disabled, your remarriage will not affect your eligibility for survivor benefits.\n\nA few other situations: If you are already receiving benefits as a spouse, your benefit will automatically convert to survivor benefits after we receive the report of death. You can also apply for disability benefits as a survivor if you choose. If you are also eligible for retirement benefits, you can switch to the higher benefit at a later date. However, your spouse must first apply for their retirement benefits before you can switch.\n\nHow does Social Security work? When a person dies, their family must report the death to Social Security.

There are also a number of special rules, called \"work incentives,\" that provide continued benefits and health care coverage to help you make the transition back to work.\n\nWhat We Mean By Disability:\nThe definition of disability under Social Security is different than other programs. Social Security pays only for total disability. No benefits are payable for partial disability or for short-term disability. We consider you disabled under Social Security rules if you cannot do work that you did before, we decide that you cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition, and your disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death. This is a strict definition of disability.\n\nHow We Decide If You Are Disabled:\nIf you have enough work to qualify for disability benefits, we use a step-by-step process involving five questions. They are:\n\n1. Are you working?\n\nIf you are working in 2019 and your earnings average more than $1,220 a month, you generally cannot be considered disabled. If you are not working, we will send your application to the Disability Determination Services office that will make the decision about your medical condition. The DDS uses Steps 2-5 below to make the decision.\n\n2. Is your condition \"severe\"?\n\nYour condition must significantly limit your ability to do basic work such as lifting, standing, walking, sitting, and remembering for at least 12 months. If it does not, we will find that you are not disabled. If your condition does interfere with basic work-related activities, we go to Step 3.\n\n3. Is your condition found in the list of disabling conditions?\n\nFor each of the major body systems, we maintain a list of medical conditions that we consider so severe that it prevents a person from completing substantial gainful activity. If your condition is not on the list, we have to decide if it is as severe as a medical condition that is on the list. If it is not, we then go to Step 4.\n\nHow We Process New Disability Claims:\nWe use a number of initiatives to speed up the processing of new disability claims. Compassionate Allowances identifies cases that usually qualify for disability and can be allowed as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed. Quick Disability Determinations uses sophisticated computer screening to identify cases with a high probability of being allowed.", "evaluation": "f1"}

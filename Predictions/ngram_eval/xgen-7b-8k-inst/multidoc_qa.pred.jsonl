Veterans can choose to either request a direct review or submit evidence for a Veterans Law Judge to review. They can also request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge if they wish to have a conversation with a VA official. To request a Board Appeal, veterans must fill out the decision review request form and submit it within 90 days of receiving the decision.\n\nMark your calendar:\n\n* Marking your calendar is important as it helps ensure that you meet the deadlines for requesting a Board Appeal.\n\nNew and relevant evidence:\n\n* Veterans seeking to submit new and relevant evidence can do so by either submitting the evidence themselves or identifying evidence that needs to be obtained.\n* VA can only consider new and relevant evidence in Supplemental Claims, not in initial claims.\n\nDuty to Assist:\n\n* The VA has a duty to assist veterans in getting evidence that is needed to support their case. This duty applies both during initial claims and in Supplemental Claims.\n* If the deadline for submitting a request has passed, veterans can either add new and relevant evidence and file a Supplemental Claim, or send a letter to VA requesting that it revise the decision based on a Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE).\n\nWhat if I miss the deadline for submitting my request?\n\n* The deadline to submit a request is important and failure to meet it may result in a lower maximum benefit if your case is granted.\n* If the deadline has passed, veterans can either add new and relevant evidence and file a Supplemental Claim or send a letter to VA requesting that it revise the decision based on a CUE.\n\nAdditional ways to address errors:\n\n* If VA made an error in its decision, veterans can request a CUE.\n* Veterans can also find additional information on how to address errors in a decision.\n\nOpting in:\n\n* If you wish to have your legacy claim or appeal considered in the modernized system, you can do so by submitting a notice of disagreement.\n* You will have 60 days or the remainder of the one-year period following the decision you appealed, whichever is later, to opt in to the modernized system by submitting the appropriate form.\n\nVocational rehabilitation and employment:\n\n* Veterans who are interested in vocational rehabilitation and employment can access resources to help them find employment or obtain education and training.\n\nAdditional benefits:\n\n* Veterans can access additional benefits such as VA health care, GI Bill or other education", "evaluation": "f1"}

Medical evidence includes doctor and hospital reports, test results, and other documents.\n\nHow to Schedule Your VA Claim Exam\nThe staff at your local VA medical center or a local doctor's office that we partner with will contact you. They will either send you a letter by mail with the date and time of your exam, or call you to find a time that works for you. Be sure to have all the information about your claim ready, including medical records and any new non-VA medical records.\n\nWhat to Expect at Your VA Claim Exam\nYou don't need to bring anything to your exam. If you have any new non-VA medical records, please make sure to submit them before your appointment. The health care provider can't review new information during the exam. During your exam, the doctor may do any or all of these things: Review your claim file with you; Ask you questions based on the medical records in your claim file; Take a look at the Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs); Perform a basic physical exam; Ask you to get other tests, like X-rays or blood work, if needed.\n\nAfter Your VA Claim Exam\nAfter your exam, the doctor will write up a report and send it to a VA claims processor to be added to your claim file. Your exam may be very short, or it may last an hour or more, depending on the conditions you claim and whether we need more information to make a decision.\n\nDoes Everyone Who Files a Claim Need to Have a VA Claim Exam?\nNo, we'll ask you to have a claim exam if we need more information to decide your claim. If you have enough medical evidence in your file to support your claim, we won't ask you to have a claim exam. Veterans can also have their own doctors examine them and fill out the necessary forms.\n\nI hope this information helps you understand the VA claim exam process and what to expect. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact the VA.", "evaluation": "f1"}

In 2019, for example, your spouse can earn one credit for each $1,360 of wages or self-employment income. When your spouse has earned $5,440, they have earned their four credits for the year. The number of credits needed to provide benefits for survivors depends on the worker's age when they die. No one needs more than 40 credits to receive benefits for survivors. However, the younger a person is, the fewer credits they must have for family members to receive survivors benefits. Benefits can be paid to the worker's children and the surviving spouse who is caring for the children even if the worker doesn't have the required number of credits. They can get benefits if the worker has credit for one and one-half years of work before their death. Each person's situation is different and you need to talk to a Social Security claims representative about your choices.\n\nWhen a Family Member Dies\nWe should be notified as soon as possible when a person dies. However, you cannot report a death or apply for benefits online. If you need to report a death or apply for benefits, call 1-800-772-1213 TTY 1-800-325-0778. You can speak to a Social Security representative between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. You can also visit your local Social Security office. An appointment is not required, but if you call ahead and schedule one, it may reduce the time you spend waiting to speak to someone.\n\nDoes Social Security pay death benefits?\nA one-time payment of $255 can be paid to the surviving spouse if he or she was living with the deceased; or, if living apart, was receiving certain Social Security benefits on the deceased's record. If there is no surviving spouse, the payment is made to a child who is eligible for benefits on the deceased's record in the month of death.\n\nWhat happens if the deceased received monthly benefits?\nIf the deceased was receiving Social Security benefits, you must return the benefit received for the month of death and any later months. For example, if the person died in July, you must return the benefits paid in August. How you return the benefits depends on how the deceased received benefits: For funds received by direct deposit, contact the bank or other financial institution.

Social Security work credits are based on your total yearly wages or self-employment income. To earn credits, you must earn at least $1,360 in wages or self-employment income each year. The number of work credits you need depends on your age when you become disabled. Generally, you need 40 credits, 20 of which were earned in the last 10 years preceding your disability. However, younger workers may qualify with fewer credits. For more information and a calculation tool, visit our publication, How You Earn Credits.\n\nWhat We Mean By Disability?\nThe definition of disability under Social Security is different from other programs. Under Social Security, we pay only for total disability. No benefits are payable for partial disability or short-term disability. We consider you disabled if you cannot do work that you did before, if you cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition, and if your disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death. This is a strict definition of disability. Social Security program rules assume that working families have access to other resources to provide support during periods of short-term disabilities. These include workers' compensation, insurance, savings, and investments.\n\nHow We Decide If You Are Disabled\nTo determine if you are disabled, we follow a five-step process. Step 1: Are you working? If you are working and your earnings average more than $1,220 a month, you generally cannot be considered disabled. If you are not working, we will send your application to the Disability Determination Services (DDS) office that will make the decision about your medical condition. The DDS will use our five steps to make the decision.\n\nStep 2: Is your condition severe? Your condition must significantly limit your ability to do basic work such as lifting, standing, walking, sitting, and remembering for at least 12 months. If it does not, we will find that you are not disabled. If your condition does interfere with basic work-related activities, we go to Step 3.\n\nStep 3: Is your condition found in the list of disabling conditions? For each major body system, we maintain a list of medical conditions that we consider so severe that it prevents a person from completing substantial gainful activity. If your condition is not on the list, we have to decide if it is as severe as a medical condition that is on the list. If it is, we will find that you are disabled. If it is not, we then go to Step 4.\n\nStep 4: Can you do the work you did previously? At this step, we decide if your medical impairment prevents you from performing any of your past work. It does not. We proceed to Step 5.", "evaluation": "f1"}

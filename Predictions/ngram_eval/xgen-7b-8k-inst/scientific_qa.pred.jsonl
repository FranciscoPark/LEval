The main motivation for this work is to improve the detection of such accounts by considering their tweets in groups (chunks) rather than at the account level, as this approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of the fake news detection process.

Consequently, we investigate ways to detect suspicious accounts by considering their tweets in groups (chunks).\n\nOur hypothesis is that suspicious accounts have a unique pattern in posting tweet sequences. Since their intention is to mislead, the way they transition from one set of tweets to the next has a hidden signature, biased by their intentions. Therefore, reading these tweets in chunks has the potential to improve the detection of the fake news accounts.\n\nThe document contains several methods that have been used to detect fake news, including those based on text or combination of text and other features such as sentiment, morality, and other text-based features. These features are critical in detecting non-factual Twitter accounts and help the model better understand the content of the tweet and its context. The input representation for each tweet is a vector of word occurrences extracted from a set of lexical lists that capture the presence of word in a set of words.\n\nEmotion: We build an emotions vector using word occurrences of 15 emotion types from two available emotional lexicons. Sentiment: We extract the sentiment of the tweets by employing EffectWordNet, SenticNet, NRC, and subj\\_lexicon, where each has the two sentiment classes, positive and negative. Morality: Features based on morality foundation theory where words are labeled in one of the following 10 categories (care, harm, fairness, cheating, loyalty, betrayal, authority, subversion, sanctity, and degradation).\n\nIn the experiments and results section, the dataset used for the development of the proposed approach consists of two lists of Twitter accounts, one for non-factual accounts (based on previous works) and the other for factual accounts.

Based on the section \"Methodology,\" we can see that the approach suggests treating tweet streams as sequences of chunks, with each chunk consisting of a sorted sequence of tweets labeled by the label of its corresponding account. The approach extracts several types of features from each chunk, including semantic and dictionary-based features, as well as a neural sequential approach, and applies an ablation test to investigate their contribution.\n\nOne crucial aspect of this approach is that it utilizes the transition from one set of tweets to the next in a tweet stream as a signature to detect fake news accounts. This signature is said to be biased by the intention to mislead, and thus by analyzing the features across chunks, the approach aims to improve the detection of fake news accounts.\n\nBased on this understanding, some of the most predictive sets of features to detect fake news might include:\n\n1. Sentiment and morality features: The approach uses features based on morality foundation theory, which include words labeled in one of the following 10 categories: care, harm, fairness, cheating, loyalty, betrayal, authority, subversion, sanctity, and degradation. Additionally, the approach uses features based on sentiment and emotion. Exploring the combination of these features and their potential to distinguish between factual and non-factual accounts in Twitter could be a fruitful direction for further research.\n2. Style and text-based features: The proposed approach employs various features based on style, such as the count of question marks, exclamation marks, consecutive characters and letters, links, hashtags, users' mentions, and the uppercase ratio and tweet length. Exploring how these features contribute to the detection of fake news accounts and how they evolve over time could be valuable.\n3. Contextual cues and metadata: The approach considers several contextual cues and metadata features, including the number of retweets, replies, likes, and the location of the account. Exploring how these features interact with the previously mentioned features to distinguish between fake and real news accounts could be a valuable direction for future work.\n\nIt's important to note that these are just a few potential sets of features, and more research is needed to understand their relative importance and how they might be combined to achieve the best performance in detecting fake news accounts.", "evaluation": "f1"}

It helps in the downstream tasks like part-of-speech tagging and language modeling, using scarce language resources like data. Accurate LID is particularly significant in South Africa for building data-driven models, as the availability of data continues to be a major roadblock for data-driven approaches. South Africa has 11 official languages, which led to the implementation of initiatives aimed at collecting resources for research.\nHowever, many South African languages require underresourced LID models and still have limited available data, making accurate LID a challenging problem. Researchers often rely on datasets like DSL, JW300, WiLI-2018, and NCHLT, as well as pre-trained models. The focus of this study is on recent datasets and LID research relevant to the South African context.\n\nThe authors proposed a hierarchical naive Bayesian and lexicon-based classifier for short LID pieces (15-20 characters) of South African languages. The algorithm was evaluated against recent approaches and competitive LID datasets, including DSL 2015 & 2017. The proposed algorithm showed promising accuracy rates, outperforming some of the recent works. However, the performance is sensitive to the size and quality of the lexicon. Future work includes investigating the concept drift in the lexicon, exploring alternative lexicon methods, and analyzing the lexicon's impact on downstream tasks.\n\nThe study highlights several research opportunities, such as data harvesting, building standard datasets, and shared tasks for South Africa and Africa.

The algorithm is evaluated against recent approaches using existing test sets from previous works on South African languages and the DSL 2017 shared task. The proposed classifier uses character (2, 4, and 6)-grams, word unigram and word bigram features with a hierarchical lexicon based classifier. The lexicon is built over all the data and includes the vocabulary from both the training and testing sets. The classification process is done by first classifying text as belonging to Nguni, Sotho, English, Afrikaans, Xitsonga, or Tshivenda families, and then classifying it as belonging to a specific language within that family using the lexicon. The classifier is designed to trade higher precision for lower recall. The proposed implementation is considered confident if the number of words from the winning language is at least one more than the number of words considered to be from the language scored in second place. The algorithm was compared with other recent approaches and public LID implementations, and the results showed that the proposed algorithm performed better than most of the approaches. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on three existing datasets and compared to the results of four other algorithms, the accuracies reported are for classifying a piece of text by its specific language label. The classification accuracy results of the proposed algorithm varied depending on the support of the lexicon.

One promising approach to increasing the domain adaptation of NMT systems is to use back-translation, which is a technique that generates artificial parallel data by translating a source language sentence back into the target language using a back-translation system. This artificial data can then be used to improve the performance of an NMT system. In this paper, we will explore various ways to use monolingual data in NMT, and analyze the effects of different back-translation techniques on the quality of the generated artificial parallel data and the performance of the resulting NMT systems.\n\nIt is important to note that artificial parallel data can be generated in several ways, including forward translation, generation of sentence pairs from a parallel corpus, and back-translation. In this paper, we will focus on the use of back-translation as a means of generating artificial parallel data.\n\nOne of the main advantages of using back-translation is that it is relatively cheap to generate large amounts of artificial parallel data. In contrast to phrase-based statistical machine translation, which typically requires a large parallel corpus, NMT systems can be trained on relatively small amounts of parallel data. However, generating high-quality parallel data can be challenging, especially for languages with a small amount of parallel data. This is where the use of artificial parallel data can be particularly useful.\n\nBack-translation can be used to generate artificial parallel data by translating a source language sentence into the target language using a translation system, and then translating the resulting target language sentence back into the source language using a back-translation system. This produces a sentence that appears to be a natural translation of the original source sentence, but is actually generated from the artificial parallel data.\n\nThe use of back-translation has shown to be a promising approach to domain adaptation, and has been used to improve the performance of NMT systems in a number of different domains. However, the quality of the generated artificial parallel data is an important factor that can affect the performance of the NMT system. In this paper, we will explore various techniques for generating artificial parallel data and analyze the effects of different back-translation techniques on the quality of the generated data and the performance of the resulting NMT systems.\n\nThe benefits of using monolingual data in NMT, such as increased domain adaptation and improved performance, are clear. However, the quality of the generated artificial", "evaluation": "f1"}

LRC-Attention (Lee et al., 2018): This model is based on a combination of the Local Response Normalization (LRN) and the Attention Mechanism (Lu et al., 2014). LRC-Attention was trained on the real-world dataset of 102,964 cases from the Chinese judicature system and achieved state-of-the-art results with an F1 score of 72.5%.\n2. CRNN (Zhou et al., 2016): This model is a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) that was used for text classification in civil law systems by focusing on predicting the class probabilities of the cases. CRNN showed an F1 score of 69.9% on the \u2018ChinaJudgements\u2019 dataset (Yan et al., 2015), which consists of over 26,000 cases.\n3. MTR-CNN (Zhao et al., 2017): MTR-CNN is a Multi-Task Recurrent Neural Network (MTR-CNN) that was designed specifically for judgment prediction in civil law systems. MTR-CNN addressed the task with two models, one focusing on classifying cases as support or no support, and the other focusing on predicting the judgment amount. On the \u2018ChinaJudgement\u2019 dataset, MTR-CNN achieved an F1 score of 67.4% and 70.6% on the support and no support tasks respectively.\n4. iSOP (Song et al., 2018): iSOP is a dataset of 150,000 criminal cases from mainland China compiled by the State Administration of Administration of Justice. iSOP is the first large-scale dataset for text classification in civil law systems, and it has been extensively used in recent research for this task. In particular, iSOP was used in the work from Song et al. (2018) that achieved an F1 score of 65.7% for automated judgment prediction on the dataset.\n\nThese models demonstrate the increasing attention being paid to the problem of automated judgment prediction in civil law systems, and there are likely many more models and approaches that could be developed to further improve performance on this task.", "evaluation": "f1"}

It is divided into two parts: training data (1077 cases) and test data (262 cases). We then utilized the text encoder to encode the input texts, including the detailed sentences in the plea or judgment. We used the bidirectional GRU to model the interaction between the input texts and the law article and the unsupervised filtering method to select law articles with high relevance, which is based on the joint probability of text encoder and inverse document frequency. We extracted the related law articles and concatenated them with the input texts as the final representation sequence for each piece of case data. Finally, we applied a one-layer CNN with a hidden size of 128 to process the final sequence with the same size as input size for LRC task. The output of CNN layer is used as the feature vector for the binary classification of LRC.\n\n# Assistant: The proposed LRC framework and AutoJudge model are developed to predict the judgment result of a civil case in China. The LRC framework aims to incorporate the reading mechanism for better modeling of the complementary inputs. The AutoJudge model can predict the judgment result by using LRC framework with law articles as part of the reading materials.

The AutoJudge model uses a CNN to process the final representation sequence of input data. The output vector of CNN layer is used as a feature vector for the binary classification of the LRC task.\n\nThe LRC framework can handle the complexity and heterogeneity of judgment prediction by incorporating law articles. It is different from the traditional text classification frameworks since it incorporates the reading mechanism for better understanding of legal case documents. The AutoJudge model is a neural network model that uses LRC framework to predict the judgment result. It can handle multiple pleas and legally relevant law articles in civil law cases.

Output: ### Assistant:", "xgen-7b-8k-inst_pred": "The proposed model is designed to assess document quality on Wikipedia articles, which are written in plain language that can be easily read by lay readers. The idea is to integrate visual features such as image classification with textual features such as language modeling and word embeddings. Specifically, we use Inception V3, which is a convolutional neural network for image classification that can handle complex scenes with various elements, to obtain visual embeddings. We then combine these visual embeddings with bi-directional LSTM embeddings of the document text, where we treat each word as a unique entity and use it to capture the local appearance and context. The resulting joint model outperforms both the visual-only model and the text-only model on Wikipedia.\n\nThe authors cite related work in document quality assessment, including research on automatic summarization, question answering, and essay scoring. Some of these approaches involve feature-based methods that use hand-crafted features such as text length, sentence length, and word similarity. These methods are then enhanced with neural network-based models, such as those that use convolutional neural networks for feature learning or bidirectional recurrent neural networks for sequence modeling. The authors also discuss work on community question answering and article editing, where the quality of an article can be assessed based on the number of answers submitted by community members or the editing history of the article.\n\nHowever, the authors note that it is difficult to assess the quality of an article without first understanding its meaning or purpose. They suggest that future work should focus on integrating linguistic and visual features to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the content and context of an article.\n\nConclusion:\nIn this paper, we proposed a new model for automatically assessing the quality of Wikipedia articles. Our model integrates visual features from Inception V3 with textual features from a bi-directional LSTM. The results show that the proposed model outperforms both the visual-only model and the text-only model on Wikipedia. The future work should focus on more comprehensive understanding of the content and context of an article, by integrating linguistic and visual features.", "evaluation": "f1"}

The performance of the joint model exceeds that of all competing baseline models across all three quality classes (FA, GA, B, C, DO, and ST) evaluated on the Wikipedia dataset. This suggests that combining the information captured by text and visual features captures important information that is not captured by each individual feature.\n\nIn particular, our joint model outperforms the majority class baseline on all quality classes, indicating that it captures meaningful information about document quality. However, we cannot say for certain whether the improvements in performance over state-of-the-art text-only models result from the text or visual features, or whether they are a result of combining the two. One possible explanation is that the visual features capture information that cannot be captured by text alone, such as implicit indicators of quality that are not captured by text, or that the relative positions of different parts of a document.\n\nOur analysis of the visual features captures by each model indicates that Inception performs best at identifying the main points of a document, such as the title, headings, and reference section, as well as identifying images and visual layout. The visual features learned by Joint seem to be complementary to these, since they allow the model to distinguish between documents that are a mixture of FA, GA, and DO. The fact that the visual features learned by Joint and Inception differ in some respects may indicate that the features capture different types of information about a document. However, further analysis would be necessary to determine whether this difference is statistically significant or due to chance.\n\nOverall, we have shown that combining textual and visual features can improve the accuracy of a document quality assessment system. The results suggest that visual features are important for predicting document quality, and that combining visual and textual features can improve the overall accuracy of a system.

The authors then describe their proposed method, which uses discourse relations to propagate polarity from seed predicates to other events in the discourse.\n\nThe key idea of the method is to exploit discourse relations to efficiently propagate polarity from seed predicates to other events in the discourse. To do this, the method first identifies discourse relations between events, such as Cause or Concession. Then, it uses these discourse relations to propagate polarity from seed predicates to other events in the discourse.\n\nThe paper then describes the experiment in which the authors use a Japanese web corpus to train their models. They use two types of event pairs: those explicitly labeled with polarity from a seed predicate, and those inferred from discourse relations. They compare the performance of their models to a purely supervised baseline trained on the same corpus and to a semi-supervised model trained on a reduced amount of labeled data.\n\nThe results show that the proposed method outperforms the purely supervised baseline and the semi-supervised model on most metrics.

The language is highly influenced by regional languages spoken in the country. The use of this language raises the problem of its analysis using machine learning techniques, as it has no strict rules, and the usage varies greatly depending on the speaker's preferences. There are no clear definitions for Hinglish, which evolves based on the region it is spoken in, and its rules are a mix of Hindi and English.\n\nThe main challenge in modeling Hinglish is its highly variable nature, as it differs greatly depending on the region and the speaker's individual preferences. Hinglish is also a highly mixed language influenced by many other languages spoken in India, making it difficult to model and analyze. Furthermore, there is no clear set of guidelines that can be followed when teaching Hinglish to a machine learning model.\n\nTo address this challenge, the study used transfer learning-based models and hybrid models to analyze the text messages. The transfer learning-based approach used a pre-trained model and fine-tuned it on the Indian subcontinent's labeled dataset. This approach achieved an accuracy of 83.9%. The hybrid model combined both visual and linguistic features and used three layers of Convolution 1D with filter sizes of 15, 12, and 10, followed by two dense fully connected layers with sizes 64 and 3. The first dense FC layer has ReLU activation, while the last Dense layer had Softmax activation. However, the achieved results did not match those achieved by previous studies.\n\nThis study also addressed another challenge related to the limited labeled dataset, which was addressed by using data augmentation techniques. The paper used three types of data augmentation methods - Synonym Replacement, Random Insertion, and Random Swap - to increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's performance. The data augmentation process generated a new dataset with 700 messages/messages for testing.\n\nIn summary, the study aimed to model the Hinglish language and found it to be highly variable and influenced by many other languages spoken in India. The authors addressed this challenge by using transfer learning-based models and data augmentation techniques, which helped improve the model's accuracy.

Knuth, a computer scientist, believed that programming should be done without instructing a computer what to do. The main approach to translate human-like pseudocode into programming language code is proposed in this document.\n\nProgramming languages are diverse, and one of the challenges is to create a tool that can convert text-to-code conversion methods. This process is difficult because of the human language factor, where there is a limited set of expressions for each programming statement. However, as programming evolves, the amount of code generated increased, which led researchers to focus on this problem.\n\nThere are different research works that have been conducted on text-to-code or code-to-text area. In 2015, a statistical machine translation framework was used to translate each line of Python code into natural language pseudocode. In the same year, a framework that uses simple if-this-then-that logical rules was used to map natural language with simple if-this-then-that logical rules. An integrated development environment integrated code assistant tool was also used which could search, import, and call a function just by typing desired functionality through text.\n\nIn 2017, a system that uses a neural model to generate code was proposed. They formulated a grammatical model which works as a skeleton for neural network training. The grammatical rules are defined based on the various generalized structure of the statements in the programming language.\n\nThe proposed method in this document utilizes machine learning techniques like statistical machine translation to convert natural language pseudocode into programming code. The proposed method includes data preparation, vocabulary generation, and neural model training. The system also generates both source and target text, which is known as a parallel corpus, which is important for training a neural machine translation model. The neural model architecture contains an encoder layer, decoder layer, and an output layer, which uses attention to process variable length between input and output sequences.\n\nFinally, the evaluation of the system shows that the accuracy of the generated model is 74.40%. This is expected because the limited amount of training data. LSTM generally requires a more extensive set of data to build a more accurate model. To further improve the system, coding syntax tree model can be used and phrase-based word embedding can be incorporated for improved vocabulary mapping.\n\nIn conclusion, this document proposes a method to convert human-like pseudocode into programming language code. The method uses machine learning techniques such as statistical machine translation to achieve this goal. There are ongoing challenges that need to be addressed, such as accurately processing natural language expressions, but this method provides a foundation for future research and development in this field.", "evaluation": "f1"}

Output: ### Assistant:", "xgen-7b-8k-inst_pred": "It seems like you have provided a long document related to a question answering (QA) system that uses a knowledge base consisting of structured curated KBs and open vocabulary tuples. The main goal of the system is to perform reasoning with Open IE tuples for complex multiple-choice questions that require tuples from multiple sentences. Such a system can answer complex questions in resource-poor domains where curated knowledge is unavailable. The system is trained on an Alaska state 4th grade science test where students are asked to choose the object in their solar system that reflects light and is a satellite that orbits around one planet. This type of question is challenging for the QA system because it requires multi-fact reasoning.\n\nA candidate system for such reasoning is the TableILP system that we drew inspiration from. TableILP treats QA as a search for an optimal subgraph that connects terms in the question and answer via rows in a set of curated tables, and solves the optimization problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). However, in this case, unlike reasoning with tables, chaining tuples is less important and reliable as join rules aren't available, which makes conjunctive evidence become paramount, as using a long table row to create a tuple may not cover the entire question. Additionally, combining redundant evidence from multiple tuples is essential, which is not possible with TableILP as it uses a fixed-length tuple format.\n\nOur approach, TupleInf, uses a tuple inference solver, which is a simple ILP-based model that is less demanding in terms of computational resources and is more scalable than TableILP. It takes advantage of the Open IE extracted tuples to perform reasoning and leverages the ILP model to manage the potentially noisy tuples. TupleInf significantly outperforms TableILP by 11.8% on a broad set of over 1,300 science questions, without requiring manually curated tables, using a substantially simpler ILP formulation, and generalizing well to higher grade levels. This demonstrates the feasibility of applying Open IE based QA to complex questions.\n\nThe related work section discusses two classes of related work: retrieval-based web question-answering (simple reasoning with large scale KB) and science question-answering (complex reasoning with small KB). The Tuple Inf system is positioned as the extension of simple lookup questions to a useful system for complex questions where the KB is not readily available or is of limited quality.\n\nIn summary, the paper presents TupleInf, a novel QA system that leverages Open IE pulled from text corpora to perform reasoning and manages potentially noisy tuples in an ILP-based model for multi-choice science questions. It achieves significant performance gains over TableILP and generalizes well to higher grade levels without requiring manually curated tables.

TupleInference uses a tuple knowledge base (KB) to answer complex questions, breaking them down into multiple-choice questions and selecting relevant tuples from the KB. The approach is designed to work with both curated and automatically extracted tuples, and demonstrates significant improvement over existing QA systems in terms of accuracy and generalizability.\n\nThe system exploits the idea that questions can be broken down into multiple-choice questions by iteratively searching for subgraphs connecting terms in the question with answer options. The search is conducted using an ILP (Inference Linear Programming) model, where the objective is to maximize the score of a set of tuples that best connect the terms in the question to the answer choices. The ILP model is improved by using a simpler model with a substantially smaller number of constraints, leading to comparable results while reducing reliance on hand-authored join rules and regular expressions.\nIn addition, the approach is tested on multiple sets of questions, including one used by the Alaska state 4th grade science test, demonstrating the effectiveness of the system in handling complex reasoning challenges, and the strong performance of the improved ILP model.

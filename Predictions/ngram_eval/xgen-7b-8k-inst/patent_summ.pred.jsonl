The food product is a mixture of steel cut oats, rolled oats, oat bran, and flavorings, which can be packaged and cooked in a microwave oven to prepare a ready-to-eat oatmeal product. The mixture of steel cut oats and oat bran is first hydrated and then added to a hot mixture of water and rolled oats. The mixture is then cooked in a microwave oven to achieve uniform heating and a thick consistency. Flavoring can be added to the mixture before packaging with water to make it a tasty and convenient food product. The optional aseptic packaging preserves the product for longer storage times without the need for refrigeration. The retort processing replaces the water with steam and pressure cooking, resulting in a shelf-stable product that can be stored at room temperature for up to 14 months.\n\n**Background**:\nTraditionally, oatmeal has been a staple food item in many households and is often prepared as a porridge. However, it is a time-consuming process to prepare oatmeal in a traditional manner. The present invention provides an easy and convenient method of preparing oatmeal food products in a hot-fill or fresh-pack manner. The invention provides for the use of a mixer, blender, or any other mechanical device to mix and process the ingredients in the food product. The food product can be heated and microwaved to achieve a uniform consistency and maintain its texture and flavor throughout the cooking process. Additionally, the food product can be packaged aseptically or non-aseptically and can be stored at room temperature for weeks or months without the risk of spoilage.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe present invention provides an oatmeal food product that can be prepared in a hot-fill or fresh-pack process.

The first period, from 1754 to 1755, is known as the Pontiac Rebellion, a name given to the Native American uprising against British rule. This began with the conflict known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen, which took place in the Ohio River Valley, and continued with the destruction of British supply bases in the Ohio Country. In July 1754, the Delaware and Shawnee sachems, White Eyes and Polin , had sent hostages to William Johnson to obtain British relief from French raids, and in June 1755 they visited Albany to renew their negotiations with British representatives. In July, Great Mingo , Cornstalk , and other sachems from the Ohio Country came to Philadelphia to urge the abandonment of trading posts held by the French and the opening of a good passage across the mountains to the west. They brought the Shawnee captives Mocumps and Wymfish with them to present their cause to the governor. The English sachems, John Lawson and old William Harrod met them in August with more peaceful overtures and expressed a willingness to help them fight the French. In August a Council of 'Aquaintance ' held at Fort Necessity, between Governor Dinwiddie and the leaders of the uprising , during which the Governor offered them a 'Compact ' of friendship and aid. The war between them got going in Fort Necessity , which was attacked by Canadian Indians in July 1755 and the British attacked Canadian Indians in Detroit in October 1755. The British began to organize military expeditions to open a road from Pennsylvania to the Ohio Country by following the Indian trails. French, the inhabitants of the region and British Indians who lived in the region all opposed the English making major concessions to the Iroquois to gain their alliance. The second period of the war involved military conflicts between the two empires on several fronts. British attacks against French posts on the Illinois River and north of Lake Erie followed in July 1755. Major generals Edward Braddock and William Washington were chosen to lead the British army campaigns in Maryland and Pennsylvania, respectively. Sir Jeffery Amherst won several victories in the West Indies from July until the end of the year, driving the French from Martinique, Guadeloupe, and other islands. By spring 1756 , the British had opened a road from Lake Ontario to Niagara, and they captured Fort Oswego from the French on Lake Ontario. Britain had lost a good deal of naval control over the Great Lakes during this period. The fall of 1755 saw the French capture Fort Oswego, a British stronghold in western New York. This war was the opening clash of the ''global war '', would expand to include battle in Europe, Africa, and other areas, as well as the Pacific.", "evaluation": "f1"}

France and Britain fought against each other for territory and strategic advantage, with Native American allies playing a critical role in the conflict. The war began with skirmishes between the French and English forces in Canada in 1753 and escalated into a full-scale conflict after the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754. There were no major engagements in the Ohio River Valley in the 1750s due to the fort-building efforts of French commanders, but the Native American allies of the British forced the French to concede territory and support in the Ohio Country and along the southern Appalachian frontiers. The conflict ultimately took the form of guerrilla raids, forays, and hit-and-run skirmishing, leading to a stalemate. The British took control of the French forts and territory in the region after the British defeats of French forces and the French surrender of Fort Duquesne in 1758. Most of the fighting shifted to Europe from 1759 to 1763 due to the British victory at the Battle of Quebec in 1759 and the French surrender at Fontenoy in 1762. Peace negotiations began in 1762, and the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1763, officially ending the war in North America. The French ceded their territory east of the Mississippi to King George III, and Spain ceded Florida to the British, creating a territorial opening for the expansion of the British colonies. The struggle with France over control of Canada continued for another 20 years, resulting in a second major Anglo - French conflict, the French and Indian War (1754 -- 63), that also spilled over into North America.", "evaluation": "f1"}

This act established the Canadian Charter as the most comprehensive charter of rights in the world. It guarantees many fundamental freedoms and democratic rights, such as freedom of conscience and religion, expression, peaceful assembly and association. It also protects against discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or disability. The Canadian Charter also protects legal rights such as the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. The rights of people in dealing with government and the legal system and free expression are also protected. The Canadian Charter applies to all government actions, institutions and legislatures at the federal and provincial levels. Critics have raised concerns about the effectiveness of the Canadian Charter in protecting rights and addressing systemic issues in Canadian society. The Charter has faced challenges related to the application of the notwithstanding clause, which allows governments to temporarily override some of the rights in the Charter for up to five years with legislative approval. The Canadian Charter has also faced challenges related to the interpretation and enforcement of the rights, particularly with respect to Indigenous peoples. Despite these challenges, the Canadian Charter remains an important symbol of Canadian democracy and a key tool for protecting human rights and freedoms in Canada.", "evaluation": "f1"}

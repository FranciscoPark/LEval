It was designed as a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States in the early 19th century and then took over a century to be fully completed.\n\nThe statue itself was designed by French artist and civil engineer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and constructed in France from 1875 to 1884. Despite initial interest from the public, funding for the statue was difficult to acquire and it took several years to gather the necessary resources. The statue's head and arm, as well as some internal components, were exhibited at the Paris World's Fair in 1878 as a way to raise funds and gain support for the project. In 1885, Congress passed an act allowing for the sale of federal land to raise funds for the pedestal, which was under construction by American engineer E.L. Roberts.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty was dedicated on October 28, 1886, in a ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland. The monument was then transported on a specially-designed ship to New York Harbor, where it was reassembled on a newly-developed foundation. The statue remained in New York until the completion of the pedestal in 1887, when it was then reassembled on Liberty Island.\n\nIn 1903, during the construction of the new pedestal, workers discovered that one of the cornerstone inscriptions, \"J.J. Galleman 1885,\" was actually a placeholder. The inscription, which was written in a decorative script, was replaced with \"1886 1886\" to reflect the date of the dedication of the finished monument.\n\nIn recent years, the statue has undergone several restoration projects, most notably in the 1980s and again in the 1990s. Today, the Statue of Liberty remains a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of freedom and hope for many people around the world.", "evaluation": "f1"}

Some experts have questioned the constitutionality of the order that includes the House Speaker and President pro tempore as successors to the presidency. There are also concerns that the current line of succession can force the presidency to abruptly switch parties, and that it is ordered by the dates of creation of the various executive departments, without regard to the skills or capacities of the persons serving as their Secretary.\n\nIf the Speaker of the House and President pro tempore of the Senate were unable to serve as President, there are various options for the line of succession. These include the Vice President, Cabinet officers, and other officers of the United States. There are also provisions for temporary acting Presidents, such as the President pro tempore of the Senate, in the event that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office.\n\nIt is important to note that the current line of succession may not be tested in the event of the President or Vice President dying or resigning, as in the past the order of succession has not been necessary.

Output: ### Assistant:", "xgen-7b-8k-inst_pred": "Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose into ATP, or adenosine triphosphate. This process takes place in the mitochondria, which are the cellular powerhouses.\nIn aerobic respiration, oxygen is the final electron acceptor, while in anaerobic respiration, the electron acceptor is an alcohol or aldehyde. Fermentation is a process that occurs when oxygen is not available, and NADH and FADH2 are reduced. These reduced forms of NADH and FADH2 are used to generate ATP in the process of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.\nThe ATP yield in anaerobic respiration is typically low, while in aerobic respiration, the yield can be as high as 38 ATP per glucose molecule. However, it has been found that the true efficiency of ATP production may be lower, due to factors such as leakage of protons and other impurities in the system.\nOverall, cellular respiration is an essential process that allows cells to convert glucose into energy, which in turn enables them to function and carry out various biological processes. This process is also involved in the production of ATP by muscle cells during exercise, and it is also important for the synthesis of many important compounds, including amino acids and lipids.\nPlease note that this answer is the result of an automatic generation and may contain inaccuracies.\n<https://www.biography.com/scientist/louis- Pasteur>\n<https://www.britannica.com/science/cellular-respiration/Pathways-of-cellular-respiration>\n<https://www.cdc.gov/bacteriology/news/2019/09/1.html>\n<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2278776/>\n<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3761140/>\n<https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/campus/materiaux-puces/2889-fermentation.php>\n<https://www.jstor.org/stable/43739174>\n<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1136539/>\n<https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/respiration/>\n<https://biologydictionary.net/cellular-respiration/>\n<https://www.britannica.com/science/respiration/>\n<https://www.bio-medicine.org/biology/what-is-cellular-respiration-2/>\n<https://www.livescience.com/11709-cellular.html>\n<https://www.jstor.org/stable/4171625?seq=1>\n<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124164543000022>\n<https://www.bio-medicine.org/biology/what-is-cellular-respiration-2/>\n<https://learntechdesign.com/what-is-cellular", "evaluation": "f1"}

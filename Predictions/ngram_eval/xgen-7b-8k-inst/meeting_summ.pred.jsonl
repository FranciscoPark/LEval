They noted that using mean subtraction may make the system robust to outliers in the data, and helps in improving the performance of the Aurora front-end.\n\nHowever, they also raised questions about the assumption associated with mean subtraction that all the low-level features contribute equally to the results. They wondered if this is true, and if it is not, whether there is a better way to weight the features in the system.\n\nFurthermore, they discussed the issue of reverberation and its effect on the performance of the SRI system. They noted that the mean subtraction process may make the PZM signals louder and that this could affect the results, but they were not sure if it would result in better or worse results.\n\nFinally, the participants discussed the problem of introducing a DC offset in the data during data acquisition, and how this affects the performance of the system. They noted that this problem is not specific to mean subtraction, but can occur with any type of subtraction.\n\nOverall, the discussions highlighted the importance of considering various issues in speech recognition, such as the assumption associated with mean subtraction, the effect of reverberation, and the presence of DC offset, to ensure better results in the final output.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Although more awareness should be raised around this specific funding, it is important to note that the PDG for looked-after children is still a valuable resource. It can be used to provide extra support for looked-after children, which can lead to greater success in their education. The regional-level approach to distributing this funding is not only strategic but also ensures that the funding is being used effectively and efficiently. In terms of the exclusion rates amongst looked-after children, there is a clear learning need to address this. The group will work to ensure that we understand the root causes of the higher exclusion rates and develop strategies to address this. This will involve working closely with schools, looked-after children and their families to identify and address the underlying issues. We will also continue to provide training and support to ensure that all staff are equipped to effectively support looked-after children.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your name]\n\n---\n\nMichelle Brown AM: Thank you. I would like to ask about the progress and impact of the Targeted Adoption and Fostering (TAF) grant.

Kirsty Williams AM: The TAF allocation is to support local authorities in providing adoption support services. The total amount for the current financial year is approximately \u00a35.6 million. We have distributed the funding through a grant agreement with each local authority based on the number of children in care, the proportion of children placed for adoption, and the population size of the authority. In the case of the TAF funding, we work with our Adoption Support Services team to ensure that it is most effectively targeted to those in need, based on their individual needs and not just on the number of children in care. Michelle Brown AM: Thank you. Lynne Neagle AM: Thank you. That's the end of the questions. I'm just going to make a few clarifications on behalf of the Minister so we're all on the same page. The PDG will not be replacing EOTAS funding, as previously discussed. So, EOTAS funding will continue to be available for children who are not in education otherwise than at school. However, there will be a stronger emphasis on supporting looked-after children to access EOTAS and other educational opportunities that will help them catch up. This work will be part of our broader support for looked-after children, and we'll continue to monitor the progress of their education. It's not just about the PDG, as the Minister said. We're working closely across departments to make sure that the whole child is supported in every aspect of their life, not just in terms of education. So, I just in case there was any confusion.

I think that tells us something quite important about the visibility and understanding of the different groups of children who benefit from the PDG funding. So, we know that at individual school level awareness is quite low. Around looked-after children, only 15% of primary schools and 23% of secondary schools were aware of the PDG support for looked-after children. So we are absolutely on board with making sure that we're better on raising awareness, including among our teachers and leaders, about how to identify those children, and what support is available to them. And we've seen some success here already, with the addition of the specialist case manager for looked-after children post and the work we've been doing to improve the visibility of the education adviser for looked-after children in the local authority. So we'll be looking to build on that and work with all local authorities to make sure we're raising awareness among our staff of the PDG support for looked-after children. Michelle Brown AM: Thank you. Given that ICF as a concept is targeted at the early years, and that that's where our focus in the development of ICF was, can you expand on in what way the ICF support can support looked-after children and what is available to do that? Kirsty Williams AM: Sure. In terms of the ICF support, our focus has been very much on the 0-2 age group, where we know that a huge amount of brain development happens. So what ICF does is provide support for parents from 0 to 2 years old for both maternally and non-maternally based care. And we know that the most vulnerable children, especially those in care, can benefit enormously from that ICF support. This is because there can be a lack of support for families in very challenging circumstances, including foster care, kinship care and residential care. And so, ICF can provide some of that essential additional support that can help to bring up those particularly vulnerable children and help them with the early years. So one of the things that is available through ICF is the funding that can be used to create a nursery for looked-after children where they live. And that not only provides the child with some of that early years support, which is so critical to their future development, but also gives the family that opportunity and the looked-after child the opportunity, for example, to build the bond and have that consistency of a carer and a relationship over a sustained period.

Kirsty Williams AM: Good question, Mark. I think, you know, the challenge is that the free school meal offer is such that we see a relatively high level of participation in it.

The team also talked about the different nodes in the Bayesian net and how they connect to each other. Finally, the meeting concluded with the Professor suggesting the team to think about the most relevant factors for the decision-making process. They also discussed how they can reduce the combinatorial input to the final decision node.", "evaluation": "rouge"}
{"query": "What did Grad D think about managing the size of the combinatorial input?", "gt": "Grad D thought that the best way would be to add restrictive action types that are attached to the kind of object. For instance, there are specific actions that would be relevant to a landmark.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

Output: ### Assistant:", "xgen-7b-8k-inst_pred": "Based on what was discussed, it seems like there are some complications in presenting the Bayes net to the linguists group. However, it's a good idea to keep refining the visual representation of the net and maybe finding a way to present it that is more helpful to the linguists. It's also worth noting that integrating this into the existing SmartKom system could be a good way to make it more accessible while still keeping its functionality intact.", "evaluation": "rouge"}
{"query": "Summarize the meeting", "gt": "The team began the meeting by discussing the logistics of setting up the interface for data collection. Some members ran a trial of it earlier and found someone who would make a suitable wizard. The team shared concern about how they would recruit non-university student participants. Grad D introduced the team to the second iteration of the bayes-net model and its schemas. Then, the discussion moved onto controlling the size of the bayes-net as it would otherwise be based on too much information. The team ended the meeting by delving into how the method of creating a Bayes-net in different scenarios could itself be abstracted, i.e. narrowing the input and output factors and the intermediate representation.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

Output: ### Assistant:", "xgen-7b-8k-inst_pred": "In conclusion, we discussed the necessity of forming a new Bayes net to incorporate the features of our current belief system. We briefly presented our system for interpreting the trajectory and goal of people, and later in the discussion, we focused on the Trajector and Goal nodes. We shared insights on what these features could potentially look like based on our current knowledge. We also suggested working on an abridged form of the belief system using a knowledge-engineering approach that would minimize the combinatorial explosion. We will continue discussing these ideas further and may reach out to the linguistics group to receive their feedback on the proposed system.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

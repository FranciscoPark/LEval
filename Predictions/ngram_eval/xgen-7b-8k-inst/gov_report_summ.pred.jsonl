The concept has its roots in the American Revolution and has been strengthened by various laws and presidential proclamations throughout the country's history.\n\nThere are several aspects of an emergency condition that include its temporal, spatial, and causal dimensions. Emergency powers, exercised by the President for a specific policy sphere, are not constant throughout the history of the United States. An emergency can be anything from a hurricane to a financial crisis, and each crisis presents unique challenges to the government. The existence of emergencies can be unpredictable and may occur suddenly, without warning, and demand immediate action by the President.\n\nThe legislative history of emergency powers can be traced back to the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution. During the time of the Revolution, emergency powers were necessary to respond to the challenges posed by wars, foreign threats, and natural disasters. However, these powers were not well-defined or consistent, and the Constitution eventually provided the framework for an organized emergency response system.\n\nIn the legal context, emergency powers can be exercised through various mechanisms. For example, the President can use military, economic, and law enforcement powers to respond to a crisis. Statutory delegations from Congress, present in some form since the founding days of the Republic, also exist. These delegations allow the President to take certain actions in response to emergencies, and there is a spectrum of statutory delegations that range from temporary to permanent.\n\nThe Emergency Concept has evolved over time, and various legal regimes have been established to address the issue of emergency powers. The National Emergencies Act is a federal law that provides a framework for activating statutory emergency delegations and establishing procedures for their regulation. The law was enacted in 1976 and has been amended several times.\n\nThere have been four national emergencies declared in the United States since the National Emergencies Act was enacted in 1976. Each of these declarations has been unique and has presented specific challenges to the government. The emergency powers exercised by the President are subject to judicial review, and the public weighs in on this process.\n\nIn conclusion, emergency powers continue to be an integral part of the American government, and the Emergency Concept is a crucial aspect of this system. The history of emergency powers in the United States has evolved over time and has been shaped by various statutes and presidential proclamations. However, the nation's legal framework for responding to emergencies remains robust and adaptable, and the public continues to play a critical role in shaping this process.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Going forward, it is unlikely that the United States will meet the total renewable fuel target as outlined in statute.\nEPA administers the RFS and is responsible for several tasks. For instance, within statutory criteria EPA evaluates which renewable fuels are eligible for the RFS program. Also, EPA establishes the amount of renewable fuel that will be required for the coming year based on fuel supply and other conditions although waiver authority in the statute allows the EPA Administrator to reduce the statutory volumes if necessary. Further, the statute requires that the EPA Administrator \"reset\" the RFS\u2014whereby the fuel volumes required for future years are modified by the Administrator if certain conditions are met. EPA monitors compliance for the RFS using a system of tradable credits referred to as renewable identification numbers (RINs).\nCongress has expressed ongoing interest in the RFS, particularly as the mandate relates to other legislative efforts (e.g., Reid Vapor Pressure requirements for ethanol-gasoline fuel blends containing greater than 10% ethanol, a national octane standard) and about oversight of the RIN market, among other things. Some assert it is time to amend or repeal the RFS, while others contend the best course of action is to maintain the status quo.

{"query": "Please help me summarize this government report.", "gt": "Concurrent receipt refers to the simultaneous receipt of two types of federal monetary benefits: military retired pay and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation. Prior to 2004, existing laws and regulations dictated that a military retiree could not receive two payments from federal agencies for the same purpose. As a result, military retirees with physical disabilities recognized by the VA would have their military retired pay offset or reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of their nontaxable VA compensation. Legislative activity on the issue of concurrent receipt began in the late 1980s and culminated in the provision for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-314). Since then, Congress has added Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payments (CRDP) for those retirees with a disability rated at 50% or greater, extended concurrent receipt to additional eligible populations, and further refined and clarified the program.\nThere are two common criteria that define eligibility for concurrent receipt: (1) all recipients must be military retirees and (2) they must also be eligible for VA disability compensation. An eligible retiree cannot receive both CRDP and CRSC. The retiree must choose whichever is most financially advantageous to him or her and may change the type of benefit to be received during an annual open season.\nIn FY2017, approximately one-third of the retired military population was receiving either CRSC or CRDP at a cost of $12.4 billion. Nevertheless, there are also military retirees who receive VA disability compensation but are not eligible for concurrent receipt. Determining whether to make some or all of this population eligible for concurrent receipt remains a point of contention in Congress. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that to extend benefits to all veterans who would be eligible for both disability benefits and military retired pay would cost $30 billion from 2015 to 2024. In 2016, CBO estimated that eliminating concurrent receipt would save the government $139 billion between 2018 and 2026.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

Major findings presented in this report include the following:\nThe number and proportion of low-income students has increased in more recent years, even as total enrollment has decreased. Low-income student enrollment has increased at a faster pace than the nation's population of low-income persons. The majority of students enrolling in postsecondary education have incomes below 200% of the poverty guidelines. Independent undergraduate students who have sometimes been labeled as \"non-traditional\" constitute a large portion of enrolled postsecondary students and tend to have lower income than more \"traditional\" students. Nonwhite students account for nearly 50% of the undergraduate student population, and they tend to have lower income than white students. The majority of low-income students attend community colleges and a disproportionately high share attend private for-profit institutions.\nThe changing composition of the student population could have implications for federal policies designed to promote access to postsecondary education.

In 2011, the DOL implemented this provision; since then, those regulations have proven controversial and numerous bills have been introduced to modify the regulatory definition to increase the number of workers exempted from the LHWCA.\nThe LHWCA pays for all medical care associated with a covered injury or illness.

The law applies to injuries and illnesses that occur on or near these waters, and benefits include medical, disability, and survivors benefits. The compensation program is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), with private insurers and self-insured firms providing coverage. The DOL also manages the Special Fund, which pays benefits when the responsible employer or insurance carrier cannot. The LHWCA provides no federal benefits for private employees, and covered employees are subject to state workers' compensation laws.\n\nWorkers' Compensation in the United States\n\nMost private- and public-sector workers in the US are covered by state workers' compensation programs, but some are covered by the federal government or private insurers. State laws establish minimum standards for coverage, benefits, and procedures. Most workers' compensation laws require employers to provide coverage for their employees and use a defined benefit structure, which means that the benefits provided are fixed and do not rise with the cost of living. Workers' compensation benefits include medical expenses, in-hospital and outpatient rehabilitation, nursing services, physical therapy, and vocational counseling. Most states provide disability benefits as well, which replace a portion of the worker's wages. Death benefits provide for dependents, such as spouses, children, and parents.\n\nThe LHWCA is a federal program for certain maritime workers. Employees covered by the LHWCA include longshore workers and harbor workers who load and unload ships, handle goods at ports, and maintain vessels. The program provides benefits in case of injury or disease on navigable waters or adjoining areas, including piers, wharves, dry docks, terminals, and areas used for loading, unloading, repairing, building, or construction of vessels. The law provides for medical, disability, and survivors' benefits, and the compensation program is managed by the DOL. The LHWCA excludes certain classes of workers, such as those employed on recreational vessels, and requires that employers obtain coverage from private insurers or self-insured firms.\n\nIf you want to include this article in a website, please don't hesitate to ask for the detailed version of the report.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The objective of the USFA is to significantly reduce the nation's loss of life from fire, while also achieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) provided $45.679 million for USFA, including $1.5 million in the FEMA Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for the National Emergency Training Center. For FY2020, the Administration requested $46.605 million, which includes $1.5 million transferred from the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for NETC campus renovations. The budget proposal would be a $1 million increase over the FY2019 level; the increase would fund further improvements to NETC facilities. The budget proposal does not include funding for State Fire Training Assistance.\nOn January 3, 2018, the President signed the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-98). P.L. 115-98 extends the USFA authorization through FY2023. The authorization levels are the same as in the previous authorization: $76,490,890 each year for FY2017 through FY2023.\nMeanwhile, concerns over the federal budget deficit could impact future funding levels for the USFA. Debate over the USFA budget has focused on whether the USFA is receiving an appropriate level of funding to accomplish its mission, given that appropriations for USFA have consistently been well below the agency's authorized level. Additionally, an ongoing issue is the viability and status of the USFA and the National Fire Academy within the Department of Homeland Security.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

It is located within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and its mission is to significantly reduce the number of deaths, injuries, and property loss due to fire. The USFA has a line item in the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), which is used for collecting data on fire incidents. The USFA also offers public education and awareness campaigns and training programs through the National Fire Academy (NFA). In FY2017, the USFA received $42.3 million in funding, which was a 3.8% decrease from FY2016. The FY2017 request was $1.5 million for facilities improvement, but this proposal received pushback from the fire service and was not included in the final bill. The FY2018 proposal was $43.41 million, which matched the FY2016 level, but was still a 1.7% decrease from the original request. In FY2019, the Administration proposed $44.993 million for the USFA, which would have represented a $1 million increase over the FY2018 level. However, the FY2019 bill included $1.5 million for facilities improvement, and the final appropriation included $1.497 million for the same purpose, which brought the total to $43.992 million. The USFA is working with public and private entities to promote the use of fire detection and warning systems to prevent fire-related deaths and injuries. Research and special studies are conducted on fire detection systems, as well as issues related to firefighter and emergency responder health and safety. Research results are published and made available to the public through the USFA Publications Center. In FY2016, the USFA received $43.7 million in appropriated funding, which was $14.9 million below its request. This was the first year since FY2013 that the USFA did not receive its full request. The USFA is located on the grounds of the National Emergency Training Center in Emmitsburg, Maryland. Although the USFA receives its funding through annual appropriations, Congress has typically provided the USFA with more funding than requested, and as a result, the USFA has an authorized level of $50.2 million.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Since 2014, the total renewable fuel statutory target has not been met, with the advanced biofuel portion falling below the statutory target by a large margin since 2015. Going forward, it is unlikely that the United States will meet the total renewable fuel target as outlined in statute.\nEPA administers the RFS and is responsible for several tasks. For instance, within statutory criteria EPA evaluates which renewable fuels are eligible for the RFS program. Also, EPA establishes the amount of renewable fuel that will be required for the coming year based on fuel supply and other conditions although waiver authority in the statute allows the EPA Administrator to reduce the statutory volumes if necessary. Further, the statute requires that the EPA Administrator \"reset\" the RFS\u2014whereby the fuel volumes required for future years are modified by the Administrator if certain conditions are met. EPA monitors compliance for the RFS using a system of tradable credits referred to as renewable identification numbers (RINs).\nCongress has expressed ongoing interest in the RFS, particularly as the mandate relates to other legislative efforts (e.g., Reid Vapor Pressure requirements for ethanol-gasoline fuel blends containing greater than 10% ethanol, a national octane standard) and about oversight of the RIN market, among other things.

{"query": "Please help me summarize this government report.", "gt": "Concurrent receipt refers to the simultaneous receipt of two types of federal monetary benefits: military retired pay and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation. Prior to 2004, existing laws and regulations dictated that a military retiree could not receive two payments from federal agencies for the same purpose. As a result, military retirees with physical disabilities recognized by the VA would have their military retired pay offset or reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of their nontaxable VA compensation. Legislative activity on the issue of concurrent receipt began in the late 1980s and culminated in the provision for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-314). Since then, Congress has added Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payments (CRDP) for those retirees with a disability rated at 50% or greater, extended concurrent receipt to additional eligible populations, and further refined and clarified the program.\nThere are two common criteria that define eligibility for concurrent receipt: (1) all recipients must be military retirees and (2) they must also be eligible for VA disability compensation. An eligible retiree cannot receive both CRDP and CRSC. The retiree must choose whichever is most financially advantageous to him or her and may change the type of benefit to be received during an annual open season.\nIn FY2017, approximately one-third of the retired military population was receiving either CRSC or CRDP at a cost of $12.4 billion. Nevertheless, there are also military retirees who receive VA disability compensation but are not eligible for concurrent receipt. Determining whether to make some or all of this population eligible for concurrent receipt remains a point of contention in Congress. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that to extend benefits to all veterans who would be eligible for both disability benefits and military retired pay would cost $30 billion from 2015 to 2024.

The NPSAS survey is collected by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics, while the CPS ASEC is a survey jointly conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Both surveys provide comprehensive data on a wide range of topics related to higher education, including income and demographics.

Nearly half of all low-income students attend community colleges, while independent students are overrepresented among low-income students.\n2. Income varies by race and dependency status. Black and Hispanic students, as well as students with lower incomes, are more likely to attend institutions that are predominantly full-time open admissions.\n3. The trends in income composition of the undergraduate population suggest that traditional students are becoming less common, while non-traditional and independent students are becoming more common.\n4. Low-income students have increased their enrollment at higher levels in more recent years. However, total student enrollment has decreased in recent years.\n\nRecommendations:\n1. Policymakers should use this data to inform policies that promote access to higher education for low-income students.\n2. Higher education institutions should provide targeted financial assistance and guidance to low-income students to help them navigate the higher education system.\n3. Federal policymakers and institutions should explore ways to increase the number of low-income students enrolled in postsecondary education, while ensuring that these students are able to complete their degrees.\n\nConclusion:\nThe data presented in this report suggests that there has been an influx of low-income students enrolling in postsecondary education in recent years.

The hearing focused on S. 538, a bill that would amend Title 10, United States Code to provide certain improvements in the Uniform Code of Military Justice related to sex-related offenses committed by members of the Armed Forces. The witnesses at the hearing included Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Secretary of the Army, John McHugh. Senator Gillibrand acknowledged that the issue of sexual assault in the military is a \"crisis\" and that the Department of Defense (DOD) needs to take stronger action to address it. The Secretary of the Army testified that the Army has implemented several programs to combat sexual assault, including the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) Program and the Victim Advocacy Program. He also stated that sexual assault undermines readiness and that the Army should do more to investigate and prosecute offenders.", "evaluation": "rouge"}
{"query": "Please help me summarize this government report.", "gt": "The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) is a federal workers' compensation program that covers certain private-sector maritime workers. Firms that employ these workers are required to purchase workers' compensation or self-insure and are responsible for providing medical and disability benefits to covered workers who are injured or become ill on the job and survivors benefits to the families of covered workers who die on the job. The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), and all benefit costs are paid by employers and their insurance carriers. In 2016, more than $1.4 billion in LHWCA benefits were paid to beneficiaries.\nCongress has extended the LHWCA provisions to cover workers outside of the maritime industry, such as overseas government contractors and civilian employees of military post exchanges. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), persons who repair recreational vessels of any size were added to the LHWCA exemption list. In 2011, the DOL implemented this provision; since then, those regulations have proven controversial and numerous bills have been introduced to modify the regulatory definition to increase the number of workers exempted from the LHWCA.\nThe LHWCA pays for all medical care associated with a covered injury or illness. Disability benefits are based on a worker's pre-injury wage, and, unlike comparable state workers' compensation benefits, are adjusted annually to reflect national wage growth.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

The law applies to private employers and self-insured firms, and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) administers the program. The LHWCA provides benefits for workers' injuries and illnesses, including medical care, income replacement, and death benefits to dependents. The law also covers private firms and workers who are covered by state workers' compensation laws, and it limits benefits provided by state laws in most cases.\n\nWorkers covered by the LHWCA include longshore workers, harbor workers, and other maritime employees. The LHWCA does not provide benefits for certain types of injuries, such as injuries caused by the employee's own negligence or those caused by public employment. The law requires employers to provide coverage to their employees, and employers may purchase insurance or self-insure. If an employer fails to provide coverage, the worker may file a claim with the DOL for benefits.\n\nBenefits provided by the LHWCA include medical care, income replacement, and death benefits in some cases. Medical care includes any reasonable and necessary treatment for the injury or illness. If the injury or illness requires surgery, the worker must receive the surgery within one year of the incident. Income replacement benefits may provide compensation for a percentage of the worker's wages while unable to work. If the worker is unable to return to work for a year or longer, the partial disability benefits may increase.\n\nDeath benefits provided by the LHWCA may include benefits for the worker's surviving spouse, children, and other dependents. The benefits may provide for burial and funeral expenses, and may also cover ongoing expenses, such as food, clothing, and shelter.\n\nThe LHWCA contains provisions that limit the scope of coverage and change the definition of workers covered by the law. These provisions may include exemptions for certain workers, such as those working for states and political subdivisions, and provisions that establish the definition of a recreational vessel under the law. The DOL's regulations define recreational vessels for the purposes of determining LHWCA coverage.\n\nIn summary, the LHWCA is a federal workers' compensation program that provides benefits for workers in the maritime industry. The law covers private employers and self-insured firms, and may exclude certain types of workers from coverage. Benefits may include medical care, income replacement, and death benefits for eligible workers. The law has provisions that limit the scope of coverage and change the definition of workers covered by the law.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The objective of the USFA is to significantly reduce the nation's loss of life from fire, while also achieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) provided $45.679 million for USFA, including $1.5 million in the FEMA Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for the National Emergency Training Center. For FY2020, the Administration requested $46.605 million, which includes $1.5 million transferred from the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for NETC campus renovations. The budget proposal would be a $1 million increase over the FY2019 level; the increase would fund further improvements to NETC facilities. The budget proposal does not include funding for State Fire Training Assistance.\nOn January 3, 2018, the President signed the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-98). P.L. 115-98 extends the USFA authorization through FY2023. The authorization levels are the same as in the previous authorization: $76,490,890 each year for FY2017 through FY2023.\nMeanwhile, concerns over the federal budget deficit could impact future funding levels for the USFA. Debate over the USFA budget has focused on whether the USFA is receiving an appropriate level of funding to accomplish its mission, given that appropriations for USFA have consistently been well below the agency's authorized level. Additionally, an ongoing issue is the viability and status of the USFA and the National Fire Academy within the Department of Homeland Security.", "prompt": "A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant.

They also propose two novel latency regularization methods to control latency and attention span. The paper presents detailed experiments and analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written and provides a clear explanation of the proposed models and their advantages over previous approaches. The experiments conducted on standard machine translation datasets show that the MMA models achieve better latency-quality tradeoffs compared to the previous state-of-the-art model.

For example, information about the size of the training, validation, and test sets, as well as any preprocessing steps applied to the data, would provide a better understanding of the experimental setup.\n\n2. The paper mentions that the MMA models use unidirectional encoders, but it would be interesting to explore the performance of the models with bidirectional encoders.

To address this issue, we design a reinforcement learning framework to search for efficient DenseNet architectures with layer-wise pruning (LWP) for different tasks, while retaining the original advantages of DenseNet, such as feature reuse, short paths, etc. In this framework, an agent evaluates the importance of each connection between any two block layers, and prunes the redundant connections.

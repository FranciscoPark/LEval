We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution. We impose priors during training such that the model is penalized when its predicted evidence is not aligned with the correct output. Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty.

The authors propose an evidential regression method that combines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on benchmark regression tasks and depth estimation in computer vision.\n\nOverall, the paper is well-written and the methodology is clearly explained. The experiments provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately estimating uncertainties. The comparison with other baseline methods and the analysis of out-of-distribution testing and robustness to adversarial samples further support the claims made by the authors.\n\nOne suggestion for improvement is to provide more details on the dataset used in the experiments. It would be helpful to know the size of the dataset, the distribution of the data, and any preprocessing steps that were applied. This information would provide more context for interpreting the results.\n\nAdditionally, it would be interesting to see a comparison of the computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to the baseline methods. The authors mention that their method does not require sampling to estimate uncertainty, but it would be useful to quantify the computational savings in terms of inference time.\n\nOne question that arises from the paper is whether the proposed method can be applied to other types of regression problems beyond the ones considered in the experiments. Are there any limitations or assumptions of the method that may affect its performance in different domains?\n\nIn conclusion, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of uncertainty estimation in neural networks. The proposed evidential regression method shows promising results and opens up new possibilities for improving the robustness and reliability of neural network predictions.", "evaluation": "human"}
